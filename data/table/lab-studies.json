    "additional_information": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired disorder of neuromuscular transmission that is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability on exertion that is exacerbated by repeated muscle activity.2-7 This autoimmune disease is caused by antibodies directed toward receptors embedded in the motor endplate of the neuromuscular junction. Progressive weakness of the ocular muscles manifesting as asymmetric ptosis and variable diplopia are the presenting symptoms in 60% of patients.5,7 Many patients progress to more generalized weakness of peripheral limb muscles and muscles required for body posture, including facial and neck muscles. Bulbar muscle weakness compromises speaking (dysarthria), chewing and swallowing (dysphagia) and respiratory muscle weakness can lead to a myasthenic crisis where patients need to be ventilated artificially.8 Clinical symptoms may be restricted to one muscle group, in particular the eye muscles (ocular MG), or may become generalized (generalized MG).5-8, Patients with MG frequently have thymic abnormalities (thymic hyperplasia or thymoma).9 Ten to 15 percent of patients with MG patients have thymoma, and up to 50% of thymoma patients develop MG.9 It is thought that the thymus plays a role in MG pathogenesis and these patients respond well to the surgical removal of the thymus gland.10, Neonatal MG can occur as a result of trans-placental transit of antibodies from an affected mother to the fetus, or in some cases, due to antibody to the fetal form of AChR.11-13 In the latter case, the mother may be unaffected. It should be noted that the AChR antibody assays employed contain a mixture of adult and embryonic AChRs allowing for the detection of autoantibodies to both proteins. In most cases affected babies are born with a diminished ability to suck and generalized hypotonia. Decrease in utero feta movement caused by MG can also result in arthrogryposis multiplex congenital, a condition where the neonate suffers from contractures in more than two joints and in multiple body areas., The majority of patients with MG have antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and, less frequently, to the other proteins at postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction.14-16 AChR antibodies impede neuromuscular transmission by a range of pathogenic mechanisms including the alteration of tissue architecture and/or by causing a reduction the density of functionality of AChRs.1,17-21 Three functionally different types of antibodies against muscle AChR can be measured.1,21-24, • AChR binding antibodies attach to the AChR activate the complement system resulting in destruction and focal lysis of the neuromuscular junction leading to the destruction of AChR and AChR-related protein at the end-plate.1,20, • AChR blocking antibodies functionally block the binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to the receptor.20 These antibodies usually occur in association with AChR-binding antibodies and have a higher prevalence in generalized MG compared with ocular MG.20, • AChR modulation antibodies crosslink receptor subunits in such as way as to cause the receptors to be internalized and degraded in a process known as antigenic modulation.20,22,25-27 Modulating antibodies are implicated with an increased risk of thymoma and the majority of patients with thymoma have modulating antibodies.28, Test for serum autoantibodies are highly sensitive and specific for generalized MG but lack sensitivity when there is pure ocular involvement.1,14,29-30 Approximately 85% of patients with generalized MG have detectable muscle AChR antibodies (of one or more types), while fewer patients with ocular MH have the antibodies (50-60%).4,30 In general, an elevated level of any one of the AChR-binding antibodies in a patient with compatible clinical features confirms the diagnosis of MG. Approximately 15 percent of individuals with confirmed myasthenia gravis have no measurable AChR binding, blocking, or modulating antibodies. Thirty-five percent of these patients (six percent of all MG patients) will have antibodies directed against a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK).10,31 Autoantibodies levels do not generally correlate with disease severity. However, in individual patients, serial antibody titers tend to correlate with disease status.18,19,32-34, Autoantibodies directed against the contractile elements of striated muscle are found in 30% of adult patients with myasthenia gravis and in 80% of those with thymoma.35-37 Striational antibodies are associated with the late-onset MG subgroup and are rarely found in AChR antibody-negative MG.",

    "additional_information": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired disorder of neuromuscular transmission that is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability on exertion that is exacerbated by repeated muscle activity.2-7 This autoimmune disease is caused by antibodies directed toward receptors embedded in the motor endplate of the neuromuscular junction. Progressive weakness of the ocular muscles manifesting as asymmetric ptosis and variable diplopia are the presenting symptoms in 60% of patients.5,7 Many patients progress to more generalized weakness of peripheral limb muscles and muscles required for body posture, including facial and neck muscles. Bulbar muscle weakness compromises speaking (dysarthria), chewing and swallowing (dysphagia) and respiratory muscle weakness can lead to a myasthenic crisis where patients need to be ventilated artificially.8 Clinical symptoms may be restricted to one muscle group, in particular the eye muscles (ocular MG), or may become generalized (generalized MG).5-8, Patients with MG frequently have thymic abnormalities (thymic hyperplasia or thymoma).9 Ten to 15 percent of patients with MG patients have thymoma, and up to 50% of thymoma patients develop MG.9 It is thought that the thymus plays a role in MG pathogenesis and these patients respond well to the surgical removal of the thymus gland.10, Neonatal MG can occur as a result of trans-placental transit of antibodies from an affected mother to the fetus, or in some cases, due to antibody to the fetal form of AChR.11-13 In the latter case, the mother may be unaffected. It should be noted that the AChR antibody assays employed contain a mixture of adult and embryonic AChRs allowing for the detection of autoantibodies to both proteins. In most cases affected babies are born with a diminished ability to suck and generalized hypotonia. Decrease in utero feta movement caused by MG can also result in arthrogryposis multiplex congenital, a condition where the neonate suffers from contractures in more than two joints and in multiple body areas., The majority of patients with MG have antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and, less frequently, to the other proteins at postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction.14-16 AChR antibodies impede neuromuscular transmission by a range of pathogenic mechanisms including the alteration of tissue architecture and/or by causing a reduction the density of functionality of AChRs.1,17-21 Three functionally different types of antibodies against muscle AChR can be measured.1,21-24, • AChR binding antibodies attach to the AChR activate the complement system resulting in destruction and focal lysis of the neuromuscular junction leading to the destruction of AChR and AChR-related protein at the end-plate.1,20, • AChR blocking antibodies functionally block the binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to the receptor.20 These antibodies usually occur in association with AChR-binding antibodies and have a higher prevalence in generalized MG compared with ocular MG.20, • AChR modulation antibodies crosslink receptor subunits in such as way as to cause the receptors to be internalized and degraded in a process known as antigenic modulation.20,22,25-27 Modulating antibodies are implicated with an increased risk of thymoma and the majority of patients with thymoma have modulating antibodies.28, Test for serum autoantibodies are highly sensitive and specific for generalized MG but lack sensitivity when there is pure ocular involvement.1,14,29-30 Approximately 85% of patients with generalized MG have detectable muscle AChR antibodies (of one or more types), while fewer patients with ocular MH have the antibodies (50-60%).4,30 In general, an elevated level of any one of the AChR-binding antibodies in a patient with compatible clinical features confirms the diagnosis of MG. Approximately 15 percent of individuals with confirmed myasthenia gravis have no measurable AChR binding, blocking, or modulating antibodies. Thirty-five percent of these patients (six percent of all MG patients) will have antibodies directed against a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK).10,31 Autoantibodies levels do not generally correlate with disease severity. However, in individual patients, serial antibody titers tend to correlate with disease status.18,19,32-34, Autoantibodies directed against the contractile elements of striated muscle are found in 30% of adult patients with myasthenia gravis and in 80% of those with thymoma.35-37 Striational antibodies are associated with the late-onset MG subgroup and are rarely found in AChR antibody-negative MG.",

    "additional_information": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired disorder of neuromuscular transmission that is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability on exertion that is exacerbated by repeated muscle activity.2-7 This autoimmune disease is caused by antibodies directed toward receptors embedded in the motor endplate of the neuromuscular junction. Progressive weakness of the ocular muscles manifesting as asymmetric ptosis and variable diplopia are the presenting symptoms in 60% of patients.5,7 Many patients progress to more generalized weakness of peripheral limb muscles and muscles required for body posture, including facial and neck muscles. Bulbar muscle weakness compromises speaking (dysarthria), chewing and swallowing (dysphagia) and respiratory muscle weakness can lead to a myasthenic crisis where patients need to be ventilated artificially.8 Clinical symptoms may be restricted to one muscle group, in particular the eye muscles (ocular MG), or may become generalized (generalized MG).5-8, Patients with MG frequently have thymic abnormalities (thymic hyperplasia or thymoma).9 Ten to 15 percent of patients with MG patients have thymoma, and up to 50% of thymoma patients develop MG.9 It is thought that the thymus plays a role in MG pathogenesis and these patients respond well to the surgical removal of the thymus gland.10, Neonatal MG can occur as a result of trans-placental transit of antibodies from an affected mother to the fetus, or in some cases, due to antibody to the fetal form of AChR.11-13 In the latter case, the mother may be unaffected. It should be noted that the AChR antibody assays employed contain a mixture of adult and embryonic AChRs allowing for the detection of autoantibodies to both proteins. In most cases affected babies are born with a diminished ability to suck and generalized hypotonia. Decrease in utero feta movement caused by MG can also result in arthrogryposis multiplex congenital, a condition where the neonate suffers from contractures in more than two joints and in multiple body areas., The majority of patients with MG have antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and, less frequently, to the other proteins at postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction.14-16 AChR antibodies impede neuromuscular transmission by a range of pathogenic mechanisms including the alteration of tissue architecture and/or by causing a reduction the density of functionality of AChRs.1,17-21 Three functionally different types of antibodies against muscle AChR can be measured.1,21-24, • AChR binding antibodies attach to the AChR activate the complement system result in in destruction and focal lysis of the neuromuscular junction leading to the destruction of AChR and AChR-related protein at the end-plate.1,20, • AChR blocking antibodies functionally block the binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to the receptor.20 These antibodies usually occur in association with AChR-binding antibodies and have a higher prevalence in generalized MG compared with ocular MG.20, • AChR modulation antibodies crosslink receptor subunits in such as way as to cause the receptors to be internalized and degraded in a process known as antigenic modulation.20,22,25-27 Modulating antibodies are implicated with an increased risk of thymoma and the majority of patients with thymoma have modulating antibodies.28, Test for serum autoantibodies are highly sensitive and specific for generalized MG but lack sensitivity when there is pure ocular involvement.1,14,29-30 Approximately 85% of patients with generalized MG have detectable muscle AChR antibodies (of one or more types), while fewer patients with ocular MH have the antibodies (50-60%).4,30 In general, an elevated level of any one of the AChR-binding antibodies in a patient with compatible clinical features confirms the diagnosis of MG. Approximately 15 percent of individuals with confirmed myasthenia gravis have no measurable AChR binding, blocking, or modulating antibodies. Thirty-five percent of these patients (six percent of all MG patients) will have antibodies directed against a muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK).10,31 Autoantibodies levels do not generally correlate with disease severity. However, in individual patients, serial antibody titers tend to correlate with disease status.18,19,32-34, Autoantibodies directed against the contractile elements of striated muscle are found in 30% of adult patients with myasthenia gravis and in 80% of those with thymoma.35-37 Striational antibodies are associated with the late-onset MG subgroup and are rarely found in AChR antibody-negative MG.",

    "additional_information": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a picovirus primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral route. HAV replicates in the liver and is shed in high concentrations in feces from 2-3 weeks before to 1 week after the onset of clinical illness. IgM antibody develops within a week of symptom onset, peaks around three months, and is usually no longer detectable after six months. The presence of IgM antibody to HAV is diagnostic of acute HAV infection., Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a distinctive serological marker of acute or chronic hepatitis B infection. HBsAg is the first antigen to appear following infection with HBV and is generally detected 1-10 weeks after the onset of clinical symptoms. HBsAg assays are routinely used to diagnose suspected HBV infection and monitor the status of infected individuals to determine whether the infection has resolved or the patient has become a chronic carrier of the virus. In patients that recover from HBV infection, HBsAg is undetectable 3-5 months after the onset of infection. In patients with chronic infection, HBsAg remains detectable for life., Anti-HBc IgM increases rapidly, peaks during the acute infection stage of HBV infection, and then falls to a relatively low level as the patient recovers or becomes a chronic carrier. Anti-HBc IgM is useful in the diagnosis of acute HBV infection even when HBsAg concentrations are below the sensitivity of the diagnostic assay., Detection of both HCV antibody and HCV RNA indicates current HCV infection. Detection of HCV antibody in the absence of HCV RNA is consistent with the absence of current HCV infection. Repeat HCV RNA testing is recommended if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease.",

    "additional_information": "ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin 1 repeats) cleaves von Willebrand factor (vWF) between a tyrosine-1605 and methionine-1606 under circulatory conditions of high shear stress.6-14 ADAMTS13 has also been referred to as von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease. Congenital or acquired deficiency of ADAMTS13 is characterized by the presence in plasma of unusually large vWF factor multimers, which are more platelet-adhesive than the smaller multimers found in normal plasma. Congenital ADAMTS13 deficiency, also referred to as Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, is an autosomal-recessive disorder that is associated with ADAMTS13 activity levels below the level of detection of activity assays (ie, >10% for the assay used by laboratory).6-9 ADAMTS13 deficiency (both congenital and autoimmune) is associated with the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the microcirculation in a clinical condition referred to as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Diagnosis of TTP involves documentation of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, evident on a blood smear. TTP is a life-threatening disease characterized by moderate to severe consumptive thrombocytopenia, red cell fragmentation, and elevated LDH levels (due to red cell destruction) and, ultimately, end-organ ischemia.8-10 Renal insufficiency and neurologic damage are end-stage manifestations of TTP that are rarely seen in countries with advanced medical care.6-9 TTP is more common in women than men and can be present at any age, but the peak is between 30 and 40 years.14 Most patients with TTP present with nonspecific constitutional symptoms, such as weakness, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. When these symptoms are associated with laboratory evidence of disseminated microvascular thrombi (also referred to as thrombomicroangiopathy [TMA]) with thrombocytopenia and/or hemolytic anemia, schistocytes and elevated LDH, TTP should be considered in the differential diagnosis.9, Antibody to ADAMTS13 is not usually detected in patients with congenital deficiency. Most TTP cases are idiopathic and are associated with antibodies to ADAMTS13 that reduce circulating functional enzyme levels. Acquired TTP is caused by autoantibodies that inhibit the proteolytic activity of ADAMTS13 and/or bind to ADAMTS13 and accelerate its clearance from plasma.11,13-18 Studies have shown that quantitative immunoassays for IgG-specific autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 are more sensitive than the functional (ie, inhibition) assays for detecting antibodies against ADAMTS13.16-18, Measurement of ADAMTS13 can play a role in differentiating TTP from a number of clinically similar conditions that have different underlying causes.7-9 These syndromes, which can be associated with pregnancy, organ transplantation, and certain medications, generally do not exhibit significantly reduced ADAMTS13 activity levels.8 Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is clinically similar to TTP, but it is associated with acute renal failure.7 Diarrhea-associated HUS accounts for most cases and is usually by infection with Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (O157:H7). Diarrhea-negative or atypical HUS (aHUS) is thought to be caused by uncontrolled complement activation occurring in both children and adults and shares many of the clinical features of TTP7,10-20; however, aHUS is not associated with severe reduction (ie, <10%) of ADAMTS13 activity.10 Disease classification based on clinical features alone can be unreliable and can result in inappropriate treatment or delay in the initiation of effective treatment.7 In patients exhibiting laboratory evidence of thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolysis, therefore, the measurement of ADAMTS13 activity can be invaluable in differentiating TTP from other clinically similar conditions.7, Severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 (<10% activity for the laboratory assay) is a relatively specific finding in patients with a clinical diagnosis of either hereditary or acquired TTP.11,21 An ADAMTS13 activity level greater than 10% (the diagnosis threshold for severe deficiency) does not completely exclude clinical diagnosis of TTP. As many as 40% of patients with clinically diagnosed TTP have ADAMTS13 levels greater than 10%.11,21 Other conditions that could have normal or mild-to-moderate deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity include hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), and other thrombotic microangiopathies associated with hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation, liver disease, DIC, sepsis, pregnancy, or effects of certain medications (eg, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, cyclosporine, mitomycin C, quinine, etc).22",

    "additional_information": "The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of the Endocrine Society has produced a practice guideline for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with primary aldosteronism (PA).1 Primary aldosteronism (PA) is defined as a group of disorders in which aldosterone production is inappropriately high, relatively autonomous, and nonsuppressible by sodium loading.1 This inappropriate production of aldosterone can result in cardiovascular damage, suppression of plasma renin, hypertension, sodium retention, and potassium excretion that can lead to hypokalemia. PA is commonly caused by an adrenal adenoma, by unilateral or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, or, in rare cases, by the inherited condition of glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA)., In the past, clinical guidelines indicated that hypokalemia was required for the diagnosis of PA. As a result, PA was considered to be a relatively uncommon cause of hypertension, accounting for <1% of cases;2,3 however, more recent studies have challenged these assumptions. Cross-sectional and prospective studies report PA in >10% of hypertensive patients, both in general and in specialty settings.4-12 Only a small subset of these patients with PA (9% to 37%) had hypokalemia.13 These studies indicate that normokalemic hypertension constitutes the most common presentation of the disease, with hypokalemia probably present in only the more severe cases. In fact, the presence of hypokalemia has low sensitivity and specificity, and a low positive predictive value for the diagnosis of PA.1, The new consensus guideline1 recommends that case detection of primary aldosteronism (PA) should be undertaken in patient groups with relatively high prevalence of PA. These include patients with:, • Joint National Commission (JNC) stage 2 (>160−179/100−109 mmHg), or stage 3 (>180/110 mmHg) hypertension, • Drug-resistant hypertension, • Hypertension and spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia, • Hypertension with adrenal incidentaloma, • Hypertension and a family history of early-onset hypertension or cerebrovascular accident at a young age (<40 years)., The new consensus guideline1 also recommends case detection for all hypertensive first-degree relatives of patients with PA. The consensus group went on to recommend the use of the plasma aldosterone:renin ratio (ARR) to detect cases of PA in these patient groups.14-20 The ARR is calculated as the ratio of the serum aldosterone (in ng/dL) divided by serum plasma renin activity (in ng/mL/hour). The guideline indicates that the diagnosis of PA provides the opportunity for health benefits provided by curative approaches including surgery or improved control of hypertension through specific medical treatment., The consensus guideline recommended that patients with a positive ARR should proceed to confirmatory testing by any of four confirmatory tests described within the document and listed below to definitively confirm or exclude the diagnosis.1, 1. Oral sodium loading, 2. Saline infusion, 3. Fludrocortisone suppression, 4. Captopril challenge, Refer to the consensus document for a more detailed description of the confirmatory test.1",

Alkaline phosphatase is used as a tumor marker.3,4 , In rickets and osteomalacia, serum calcium and phosphorus are low to normal, and alkaline phosphatase may be normal or increased. , Hypervitaminosis D may cause elevations in alkaline phosphatase. , In Paget disease of bone there is often isolated elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase. Some of the highest levels of serum ALP are seen in Paget disease. , Hyperthyroidism, by its effects upon bone, may elevate alkaline phosphatase. There is evidence that thyroid hormone (T3) acts to stimulate bone alkaline phosphatase activity through an osteoblast nuclear receptor-mediated process.5 , Hyperparathyroidism, in some patients. Pseudohyperparathyroidism. , Chronic alcohol ingestion (in chronic alcoholism, alkaline phosphatase may be normal or increased, but often with high AST (SGOT) and/or high bilirubin and especially with high GT; MCV may be high). , Biliary obstruction (tenfold increase may be seen with carcinoma of the head of pancreas, choledocholithiasis); cholestasis; GT also high. Cholecystitis with cholangitis. (In most patients with cholecystitis and cholangitis who do not have a common duct stone, alkaline phosphatase is within normal limits or only slightly increased.) Sclerosing cholangitis (eg, with ulcerative colitis), although importantly, 3% of cases of symptomatic sclerosing cholangitis may have normal serum ALP.6 Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography might be considered then in patients with diseases known to be associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis and with appropriate symptomatology even though ALP level is normal. Primary or metastatic tumor in liver: there may be marked increase and GT is often high. Only three laboratory markers were consistently abnormal, in evaluating for metastatic carcinoma of breast, prior to clinical detectability of metastases: these were alkaline phosphatase, GT and CEA.4 , Cirrhosis, especially in primary biliary cirrhosis, in which fivefold or more increases are seen. , Gilbert syndrome: Increase in intestinal alkaline phosphatase is seen.7 , Hepatitis: Moderate increases in alkaline phosphatase occur in viral hepatitis, but greater elevations of the transaminases (AST [SGOT], ALT [SGPT]) are usually found. , Fatty metamorphosis of liver (moderate increase occurs in acute fatty liver). , Diabetes mellitus, diabetic hepatic lipidosis. , Infiltrative liver diseases (eg, sarcoid, TB, amyloidosis, abscess). , Sepsis. Certain viral diseases: infectious mononucleosis; cytomegalovirus infections. , Postoperative cholestasis. Pancreatitis, carcinoma of pancreas, cystic fibrosis. , Pulmonary infarct (one to three weeks after embolism. Healing infarcts in other organs, including kidney, may also cause increased alkaline phosphatase); other situations in which angiofibroplasia occurs, such as healing in a large decubitus ulcer. , Tumors, especially hypernephroma; neoplastic ectopic production (Regan, Nagao isoenzymes). , Fanconi syndrome. , Peptic ulcer, erosion. Intestinal strangulation or obstruction, or ulcerative lesion. Steatorrhea, malabsorption (from bone, secondary to vitamin D deficiency). Ulcerative colitis with pericholangitis, other erosive lesions of colon. , Congestive heart failure. , Parenteral hyperalimentation of glucose, intravenous albumin administration. , Familial hyperphosphatasemia. , Idiopathic. , Drugs − estrogens (large doses), birth control agents, methyltestosterone, phenothiazines, oral hypoglycemic agents, erythromycin, or any drug producing hypersensitivity or toxic cholestasis. Many commonly and uncommonly used drugs elevate alkaline phosphatase, and tenfold increases may be seen with drug cholestasis. , Causes of low alkaline phosphatase are said to include: Hypothyroidism − but most hypothyroid patients have normal alkaline phosphatase. , Pernicious anemia − in very few patients. , Hypophosphatasia: Very low alkaline phosphatase values are found in the presence of normocalcemia or hypocalcemia. This diagnosis may be confirmed by quantitation of urinary phosphoethanolamine. , Malnutrition has been reported to relate to low values, but in practice, diseases causing malnutrition relate often to high alkaline phosphatase results (eg, disseminated neoplasia). , Some drugs (clofibrate, azathioprine, estrogens and estrogens in combination with androgens) lower serum ALP activity.",

    "additional_information": "Serum alkaline phosphatase is a member of a family of zinc metalloprotein enzymes that function to split off a terminal phosphate group from an organic phosphate ester. This enzyme functions in an alkaline environment (optimum pH of 10). Active center of ALP enzymes includes a serine residue. Mg and Zn ions are required for minimal activity. Enzyme activity is localized in the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, hepatic sinusoidal membranes, vascular endothelial cells and osteoblasts of bone. There are distinctive forms of ALP in the placenta and small intestine; hepatic, renal and osteoblast (bone) ALP are similar molecules. , Serum ALP activity of intestinal origin occurs only in individuals of ABO blood type O or A. They are secretors of ABH RBC antigens and also carry the Lewis red cell antigen. Serum intestinal ALP level increases in these individuals about two hours following consumption of a fatty meal. , Liver alkaline phosphatase is increased in cholestasis and inflammatory liver disease as well as in infiltrative liver disease. The enzyme is sensitive to obstructive biliary processes, even small secondary bile duct obstruction, and thus may be increased in those patients when the bilirubin is normal due to compensatory bilirubin excretion by the rest of the liver. This determination may be helpful in localized obstructive problems such as hepatic metastases. An electrophoretically slow moving isoenzyme with high relative mass may occur in some patients with bile duct obstruction and hepatic metastases and may result in false elevation of CK-MB.7 , To confirm biliary abnormality, an additional useful test is GT. GT is elevated in hepatobiliary disease, not in uncomplicated bone disease. , Serum ALP is increased during pregnancy. Marked decline of high ALP of pregnancy is seen with placental insufficiency and imminent fetal demise.",

    "additional_information": "This immunoassay is intended for the in vitro quantitative determination of C-peptide in human serum, plasma, and urine. The assay is intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with abnormal insulin secretion., C-peptide is a single chain 31-amino acid (AA 33-63) connecting (C) polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 3021 daltons.2,3 In the process of biosynthesis of insulin, the C-peptide is formed as a byproduct together with insulin by the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor molecule proinsulin, stored in secretory granules in the Golgi complex of the pancreatic β-cells. Proinsulin, in turn, was cleaved from preproinsulin.3,4, C-peptide fulfills an important function in the assembly of the two-chain insulin (α- and β-chain) structure and the formation of the two disulfide bonds within the proinsulin molecule. Insulin and C-peptide are secreted in equimolar amounts and released into circulation via the portal vein.5 As half of the insulin, but almost none of the C-peptide, is extracted in the liver, C-peptide has a longer half-life (about 35 minutes) than insulin; 5 to 10 times higher concentration of C-peptide persist in the peripheral circulation, and these levels fluctuate less than insulin.3-5, The liver does not extract C-peptide, which is removed from the circulation by the kidneys and degraded, with a fraction excreted unchanged in the urine. The concentration in urine is about 20- to 50-fold higher than in serum. C-peptide concentrations are, therefore, elevated in renal disease.2-4, In the past, C-peptide has been considered biologically inactive; however, recent studies have demonstrated that it is capable of eliciting molecular and physiological effects suggesting that C-peptide is in fact a bioactive peptide. There is evidence that C-peptide replacement, together with insulin administration, may prevent the development or retard the progression of long-term complications in type 1 diabetes.6-11, Measurements of C-peptide, insulin, and glucose are used as an aid in the differential diagnosis of hypoglycemia (factitious hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia caused by hyperinsulinism) to ensure an appropriate management and therapy of the patients. To quantify the endogenous insulin secretion, C-peptide is measured basally, after fasting and after stimulation and suppression tests. Due to high prevalence of endogenous anti-insulin antibodies, C-peptide concentrations reflect the endogenous pancreatic insulin secretion more reliably in insulin-treated diabetics than the levels of insulin itself. Measurements of C-peptide may, therefore, be an aid in the assessment of a residual β-cell function in the early stages of type-1 diabetes mellitus and for the differential diagnosis of latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) and type-2 diabetes.3,4,12-15, C-peptide measurements are also used to assess the success of islet transplantation and for monitoring after pancreatectomy.3,4, Urine C-peptide is measured when a continuous assessment of β-cell function is desired or frequent blood sampling is not practical (eg, in children).3 C-peptide excretion in urine has been used to assess pancreatic function in gestational diabetes, and in patients with unstable glycemic control in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).16,17, Although testing for C-peptide is not requested for the routine monitoring of diabetes, it is a valuable tool for the individual therapeutic decisions which are essential for an optimal long-term metabolic control.18,19, Elevated C-peptide levels may result from increased β-cell activity observed in hyperinsulinism, from renal insufficiency, and obesity.2  Correlation was also found between higher C-peptide levels and increasing hyperlipoproteinemia and hypertension.20 Decreased C-peptide levels are observed in starvation, factitious hypoglycemia, hypoinsulinism (NIDDM, IDDM), Addison disease, and after radical pancreatectomy.",

Hyperparathyroidism may coexist with other endocrine tumors (multiple endocrine adenomatosis syndromes). , Carcinoma, with or without bone metastases. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) (tumor-induced hypercalcemia) is seen especially in primary squamous cell carcinoma of lung, head and neck, but other important tumors include primaries in the kidney, liver, bladder, and ovary. It is probably caused by parathormone-like peptides. The most common solid tumors causing bone metastases are primaries in the breast and lung. Other neoplasms may also cause hypercalcemia. Differences between HPT and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy include low dihydroxyvitamin D, reduced calcium absorption,1 and the presence of a nonparathyroid tumor. Alkaline phosphatase more than twice its upper limit is more suggestive of cancer than of hyperparathyroidism. Especially if there is only a brief duration of symptoms, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and other findings suggestive of malignant disease, chloride:phosphorus ratio <29 mmol/L, chloride <100 mmol/L, high serum LD (LDH) and/or phosphorus, think first of malignant neoplasm.2 The chloride:phosphorus ratio is predominantly of value when it is <29 mmol/L, to provide evidence against a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.2  Laboratory results which would favor malignancy include anemia, increased LD and alkaline phosphatase, decreased serum albumin and chloride, and chloride:phosphorus ratio <29 mmol/L. Parathyroid hormone-related protein was recently purified and identified by molecular cloning as a 141-amino acid peptide with limited homology to PTH itself. Both peptides activate the PTH receptor to produce hypercalcemia. PTH-related protein is now recognized as the cause of hypercalcemia in most solid tumors, particularly squamous, and renal carcinomas.3, Myeloma, Leukemia and lymphoma, especially T-cell4 lymphoma/leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma., Dehydration is an extremely common cause of slight increases of calcium., Sarcoidosis (a fraction of patients have high serum calcium; usually without low serum phosphorus).

A helpful mnemonic for the differential diagnosis of the more common causes of hypercalcemia is DCHIMPS (drugs, cancer, hyperparathyroidism, intoxication with vitamin D or A, milk alkali syndrome, Paget disease of bone, sarcoidosis).1 , Causes of low calcium: , Low albumin and low total protein relate to common, usually slight decreases of calcium. The routine method measures total calcium, about half of which is bound to plasma proteins. Since the metabolically active form of calcium is the ionized state, the patient's serum protein level should be considered when interpreting a calcium result. For example, a patient's ionized calcium may be normal when the total calcium is elevated in the presence of elevated proteins and, conversely, may also be normal when the total calcium is low and the proteins are low. , High phosphorus: renal insufficiency, hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, Vitamin D deficiency, rickets, osteomalacia (Alkaline phosphatase is a test for osteomalacia.

    "additional_information": "In the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia serum calcium should be measured on at least three occasions. In primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) parathyroid hormone, serum chloride, and urine calcium are increased. Rarely, in HPT the hypercalcemia is accompanied by a low-normal PTH.8 In HPT, calcium rises, then phosphorus falls, then alkaline phosphatase rises. Alkaline phosphatase is usually not more than twice its upper limit in HPT. Measured ionized calcium and calculated ionized calcium may be helpful. , Twenty-four hour urinary calcium is increased in HPT, low in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) which is characterized by hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria. An autosomal dominant, it apparently has no complications. A ratio of renal calcium clearance:creatinine clearance <0.01 suggests this genetic disease. The calcium:creatinine clearance ratio is said to discriminate between FHH and hyperparathyroidism.2 Family studies are highly desirable. , Hypocalcemia, then hypercalcemia occur with rhabdomyolysis − induced acute renal failure.9,10",

High levels of cholesterol that reflect high levels of HPLs may be caused by an inherited defect in lipoprotein metabolism, by disease of the endocrine system, by liver disease, or by renal disease. Low levels of cholesterol in the plasma may reflect an inherited deficiency of either LDL or HDL, or they may reflect impairment of liver function. Various hormone conditions are also related to cholesterol levels. Increased serum cholesterol in hypothyroid persons shows an increased LDL and decreased HDL. Low cholesterols are found in cases of hyperthyroidism, severe liver disease, pernicious anemia, and with increased estrogens. Pregnancy is accompanied by a moderate increase. Cholesterol is increased in early hepatitis, obstructed bile ducts, primary biliary cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and diabetic meningitis. Finally, through much controversy, it appears that cholesterol is implicated in atherosclerosis and heart disease. Evaluate risk of coronary arterial occlusion, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and complications including the demise of the patient. , Increased in primary hypercholesterolemia, secondary hyperlipoproteinemias including nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, primary biliary cirrhosis, and some cases of diabetes mellitus. Low levels have been found in cases of malnutrition, malabsorption, hyperthyroidism, myeloma, macroglobulinemia of Waldenström, polycythemia vera, myeloid metaplasia, myelofibrosis, chronic myelocytic leukemia, analphalipoproteinemia (Tangier disease), abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome) (acanthocytosis), and in some individuals who subsequently present with carcinoma. Levy points out that the weak inverse relationship with cancer, mostly colon carcinoma, is limited to cholesterol levels <190 mg/dL and is limited to men.1 Hypocholesterolemia may occur with sideroblastic anemia or in the thalassemias. , Cholesterol relates to coronary heart disease risk.2 Since premature mortality from coronary arterial disease is rampant and since cholesterol levels are available as a test which can detect a modifiable risk factor, serum cholesterol remains a critical and genuinely newsworthy topic and an important test. Effective intervention is available when cholesterol studies identify subjects likely to benefit, asymptomatic persons as well as those with recognized coronary disease.",

    "additional_information": "Coagulation activation results in the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin monomer.7,8 The fibrin monomers spontaneously aggregate to fibrin and are cross-linked by factor XIII; this produces a fibrin clot. In response to the coagulation process the fibrinolytic system is activated resulting in the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin, which cleaves fibrin (and fibrinogen) into the fragments D and E. Due to cross-linkage between D-domains in the fibrin clot, the action of plasmin releases fibrin degradation products with cross-linked D-domains. The smallest unit is D-dimer. Detection of D-dimers, which specifies cross-linked fibrin degradation products generated by reactive fibrinolysis, is an indicator of coagulation activity. Fibrin degradation products are not consistently \"D-dimer\" but are a mixture of fragments and complexes of different molecular weight. The presence of D-dimer confirms that both thrombin and plasmin have been generated since it can only be produced as the result of the plasmin degradation of cross-linked fibrin. The in vivo half-life of D-dimer is approximately eight hours.11, Elevated D-dimer levels are observed in all diseases and conditions with increased coagulation activation, eg, thromboembolic disease, DIC, acute aortic dissection, myocardial infarction, malignant diseases, obstetrical complications, third trimester of pregnancy, surgery, or polytrauma.12-17 However, in the context of venous thromboembolism, symptoms being present since a certain period of time, eg, longer than a week, may produce normal D-dimer values.18 For the diagnosis of DIC a scoring system has been suggested, in which elevated D-dimer levels represent the major indicator of DIC.12 While increased levels of D-dimer are not specific for DVT or PE, low D-dimer levels may be used to rule out these conditions. The negative predictive values for DVT and PE are approaching 100% for the Innovance D-dimer assay employing a cutoff of <0.5 mg/L FEU. The negative predictive value is further enhanced through the use of a clinical probability model along with D-dimer in the decision process.12-15 Values less than 0.5 mg/L FEU in an individual with a low clinical risk of venous thrombosis can serve as the basis for not performing more expensive diagnostic tests for DVT and PE. Patients with results greater than this cutoff require further diagnostic testing to establish the diagnosis., D-dimer levels are known to increase with age; eg, median D-dimer levels in apparently healthy men aged 75 to 79 are about twice as high as in men aged 60 to 64.19 This increase in the basal D-dimer concentration is responsible for the decrease in the specificity of D-dimer measurements for exclusion of VTE in the elderly. Several studies on D-dimer for exclusion of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been reëvaluated using an age-specific cutoff.20-23 The aim was to improve the effectiveness of D-dimer testing in ruling out VTE.20-23 The cutoff provided with the patient result is the manufacturer-determined value for exclusion of VTE; however, it has been determined that D-dimer values increase with age, and this can make VTE exclusion of an older population difficult. To address this, the American College of Physicians, based on best available evidence and recent guidelines, recommends that clinicians use age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds in patients greater than 50 years of age with: (a) a low probability of PE who do not meet all \"pulmonary-embolism-rule-out criteria,\" or (b) in those with intermediate probability of PE.21 The formula for an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff is \"age/100.\" For example, a 60-year-old patient would have an age-adjusted cutoff of 0.6 mg/L FEU, and an 80-year-old patient would have an age-adjusted cutoff of 0.8 mg/L FEU.",

    "additional_information": "Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes is important in all patients 45 years of age and older and others (see below) because both are common and often have a long, pre-symptomatic stage. Additionally, both conditions meet criteria for which early detection is appropriate and advantageous, especially since simple tests are readily available and effective interventions exist., Current American Diabetes Association (ADA) testing criteria for prediabetes and diabetes in asymptomatic adults includes:, • All patients 45 years of age or older, • Consider in overweight or obese (BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m² or greater than or equal to 23 kg/m² in Asian Americans) adults of any age with one or more of the following risk factors:, - 1st degree relative with diabetes, - High risk race/ethnicity (eg, African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander), - History of CVD, - Hypertension or on therapy for hypertension, - HDL‐C value < 35 mg/dL and/or triglyceride value > 250 mg/dL, - Polycystic ovary syndrome, - Physical inactivity, - Conditions associated with insulin resistance (eg, severe obesity, acanthosis nigrans), Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), plasma glucose after 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and hemoglobin A1c (A1c) are equally appropriate assays for prediabetes and diabetes screening. 2018 ADA standards of medical care mandate that two abnormal test results (ie, both FPG and A1c) are needed for diagnosis unless there is a clear clinical diagnosis (ie, random plasma glucose greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL). A single abnormal test can be repeated using a new blood sample for confirmation., Hemoglobin A1c: Factors such as duration of diabetes, adherence to therapy, and age of patient should also be considered in assessing the degree of blood glucose control., FPG: Recent evidence revealed diurnal variation in FPG, with mean FPG higher in the morning than in the afternoon, indicating that many cases of undiagnosed diabetes would be missed in patients seen in the afternoon. Glucose concentrations decrease ex vivo with time in whole blood because of glycolysis. For this reason, samples should be centrifuged promptly. The rate of glycolysis, reported to average 5% to 7% [approximately 0.6 mmol/L (10 mg/dL)] per hour, varies with the glucose concentration, temperature, white blood cell count, and other factors. Glycolysis can be attenuated by inhibition of enolase with sodium fluoride (2.5 mg fluoride/mL of blood) or, less commonly, lithium iodoacetate (0.5 mg/mL of blood). These reagents can be used alone or, more commonly, with anticoagulants such as potassium oxalate, EDTA, citrate, or lithium heparin. Although fluoride maintains long-term glucose stability, the rate of decline of glucose in the first hour after sample collection in tubes with and without fluoride is virtually identical. (Note that leukocytosis will increase glycolysis even in the presence of fluoride if the white cell count is very high). After four hours, the glucose concentration is stable in whole blood for 72 hours at room temperature in the presence of fluoride. In separated, non-hemolyzed, sterile serum without fluoride, the glucose concentration is stable for eight hours at 25°C and 72 hours at 4°C., Glucose can be measured in serum, or plasma, but plasma is recommended for diagnosis. Glucose concentrations in heparinized plasma are reported to be 5% lower than in serum. The reasons for the latter difference are not apparent, but may be attributable to the shift in fluid from erythrocytes to plasma caused by anticoagulants. The glucose concentrations during an OGTT in capillary blood are significantly higher than those in venous blood [mean of 1.7 mmol/L (30 mg/dL), equivalent to 20% to 25%], but the mean difference in fasting samples is only 0.1 mmol/L (2 mg/dL)., Although methods for glucose analysis exhibit low imprecision at the diagnostic decision limits of 7.0 mmol/L [(126 mg/dL), fasting] and 11.1 mmol/L [(200 mg/dL), post-glucose load], the relatively large intraindividual biological variability (Coefficients of variation of approximately 5% to 7%) may produce classification errors.",

Estrone is primarily derived from metabolism of androstenedione in peripheral tissues, especially adipose tissues. Individuals with obesity have increased conversion of androstenedione to estrone, leading to higher concentrations. Estrone can be converted into estradiol and serves mainly as a precursor or metabolic intermediate of estradiol. In addition, an increase in the ratio of estrone to estradiol may be useful in assessing menopause in women.",

    "additional_information": "The euglobulin lysis time (ELT) test provides an overview of the fibrinolytic system function by measuring the time it takes for an in vitro clot to dissolve in the absence of plasmin inhibitors.6 The fibrinolytic system is initiated following activation of the contact factors in the coagulation cascade. Fibrinolytic system activation leads to the production of plasmin, a proteolytic enzyme capable of degrading fibrin and fibrinogen as well as other plasma proteins. Increased fibrinolytic activity is suggested by clot lysis that occurs in less than two hours. A shortened ELT result implies excessive fibrinolytic activity that may be primary or could be secondary to inflammation, malignancy, trauma, fracture, liver disease, or thrombolytic therapy. Clinical bleeding is a possible consequence of excessive fibrinolysis. Excessive fibrinolysis may result from increased levels of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), increased plasmin activity, decreased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), or decreased α2-antiplasmin activity. The effect of fibrinolysis is the production of plasma fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDP or FSP) and D-dimer fragments. A prolonged ELT result implies a defect in the fibrinolytic system such as elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) levels, elevated levels of α2-antiplasmin, a plasminogen deficiency, or decreased tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) activity. The ELT may also be prolonged if the fibrinogen level exceeds 600 mg/dL. Inadequate fibrinolysis may be associated with superficial or deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, coronary thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, or stroke.",

Homozygotes for the c.*97G>A variant are rare. The annual risk of VTE in homozygotes has been reported to be 1.1% per year. Individuals who carry both a *97G>A variant in the F2 gene and a c. 1601G>A (p.Arg534Gln) variant in the F5 gene (commonly referred to as Factor V Leiden) have an approximately 20-fold increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Risks are likely to be even higher in more complex genotype combinations involving the F2 c.*97G>A variant and Factor V Leiden.1 Additional risk factors include but are not limited to: deficiency of protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III-, age, male sex, personal or family history of deep vein thromboembolism, smoking, surgery, prolonged immobilization, malignant neoplasm, tamoxifen treatment, raloxifene treatment, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy, and pregnancy.

    "additional_information": "Factor II is a 72-kilodalton vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein coagulation factor that is produced by the liver.6 Normal factor II plasma concentration is approximately 100 mg/mL and half-life is about 60 hours.6 Factor II activation occurs by both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Factor II deficiency should be considered when a patient with bleeding history has both extended protime (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Inhibitors to factor II may develop in select patients with lupus anticoagulants and tends to occur more frequently in a pediatric population. These inhibitors bind factor II in plasma and clear the antibody-antigen complex resulting in a factor II deficiency and enhanced bleeding potential. A factor II Bethesda (inhibitor) assay is negative in this instance. The dilute Russell's viper venom time (dRVVT) will be prolonged in patients with factor II deficiency.7,8 , Congenital factor II deficiency is rare (fewer than 100 cases have been reported) and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.6,7 This condition affects both males and females, and the prevalence of factor II deficiency is equal in all ethnic groups.6 A few cases of combined congenital factor II, VII, IX, and X deficiencies have been reported.6 Acquired deficiencies occur with significant hepatic dysfunction, with oral anticoagulant (coumarin) therapy, and in individuals with vitamin K deficiency.7,8 Diminished levels that can be associated with bleeding can be observed in some patients with lupus anticoagulants due to enhanced clearance of prothrombin/antibody complexes.6,7 , Symptoms of factor II deficiency include easy bruising, hematoma formation, postsurgical hemorrhage, menorrhagia, epistaxis, and umbilical cord hemorrhage.6,7 Heterozygous individuals typically have factor II activities near 50% and are asymptomatic or have minor bleeding complications associated with trauma or surgery.7 Factor II plasma activity <30%, as can be observed in individuals with homozygous deficiency, may result in excessive bleeding following a traumatic event.6,8 Spontaneous bleeding or hemarthroses are rare but may occur in homozygotes with very low activity.6-8 , Factor II activity in excess of 115% has been associated with an increased risk of thrombosis.6 The G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene can be associated with increased plasma prothrombin levels.6,9 This polymorphism can be identified in 1% to 2% of the US population, but is highly race-dependent. This mutation is relatively uncommon in African Americans, Asians, and native Americans.9 A recent consensus conference of the College of American Pathologists on diagnostic issues in thrombophilia concluded that the prothrombin G20210A mutation is a significant risk factor of venous thromboembolism and should be considered in the initial evaluation of potential inherited thrombophilia.9",

    "additional_information": "The development of factor II inhibitors is a rare occurrence. Antibodies to prothrombin may develop in some individuals who also develop antiphospholipid antibodies, such as the lupus anticoagulant. In this instance, the antiprothrombin antibodies bind to prothrombin and result in its clearance from the circulation. This leads to low factor II activity levels and a bleeding tendency which can be severe. Because the factor II antiprothrombin antibody complex is rapidly cleared from the circulation, neutralizing antibodies cannot be measured using a Bethesda titer. Factor inhibitors (also called circulating anticoagulants or inactivators) are endogenously produced antibodies that interfere with coagulation in vivo or in vitro.6 These inhibitors are frequently specific for their respective coagulation factors. Specific factor inhibitors can be classified as neutralizing or non-neutralizing. Neutralizing inhibitors interact with the functional component of the coagulant protein and may cause clinical bleeding. Non-neutralizing antibodies react with the protein somewhere other than the functional epitopes and may be clinically silent. Factor inhibitors are not normally present in plasma. When present, factor inhibitors are measured by Bethesda titer units (BU). Titers <5 BUs are classified as low responders, titers >10 BUs as high responders. Responder status influences the approach for clinical treatment. Factor inhibitor assays are ordered in response to clinical impression, and are performed periodically on individuals who have inhibitors and are receiving therapy. During therapy, periodic assays are used, both to manage the dosage and to establish whether a patient is a low or high responder. Low responders maintain titers consistently <5 BUs, while high responders may generate extremely high titers and rapid anamnestic responses to therapy. Assays must also be performed repeatedly during inhibitor suppression therapy.",

    "additional_information": "Factor V is a large (330 kilodalton) single-chain nonenzymatic cofactor that is synthesized in hepatocytes, megakaryocytes, and endothelial cells.6,7,9 Approximately 20% of the total factor V is carried in the α granules of platelets and is released when platelets are activated.6 The structure of factor V is similar to that of factor VIII.9 Factor V's plasma concentration is 7 mg/mL and half-life is about 15 to 36 hours. Factor V activation occurs by both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Factor V deficiency should be considered when a patient with bleeding history has both extended protime (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). , Congenital factor V deficiency, sometimes referred to as parahemophilia, is rare (less than one case per million individuals) and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.6,7,9 This condition affects both males and females and the prevalence of inherited factor V deficiency is equal in all ethnic groups.9 Factor V levels are decreased both in plasma and platelets.6 A syndrome of combined factor V and VIII deficiencies has been described in over 60 families in and around the Mediterranean basin.8 , Symptoms (homozygotes) can include hematoma formation, postsurgical and postpartum hemorrhage, menorrhagia, hematuria, and umbilical cord hemorrhage.6,9 Factor V plasma activity <30% may result in excessive bleeding following a traumatic event.9 Unlike individuals with severe hemophilia, patients with factor V levels <1% do not typically develop spontaneous joint hemarthroses.6 , Diminished factor V levels can be seen in liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) syndromes, and in other consumption coagulopathies.9,10 Specific factor V inhibitors can occur, especially after surgical procedures that involve multiple exposures to bovine topical thrombin.9 Postoperative treatment with aminoglycosides and penicillin has also been associated with development of factor V inhibitors.6,7 Inhibitors do not typically develop in individuals with factor V deficiency.6 One study found that elevated factor V activity may be associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction;11 however, a recent consensus conference of the College of American Pathologists on diagnostic issues in thrombophilia did not recommend measurement of factor V levels for the assessment of thrombotic risk.10",

    "additional_information": "Factor inhibitors (also called circulating anticoagulants or inactivators) are endogenously produced antibodies that interfere with coagulation in vivo or in vitro.6 These inhibitors are frequently specific for their respective coagulation factors. Specific factor inhibitors can be classified as neutralizing or non-neutralizing. Neutralizing inhibitors interact with the functional component of the coagulant protein and may cause clinical bleeding. Non-neutralizing antibodies react with the protein somewhere other than the functional epitopes and may be clinically silent. Factor inhibitors are not normally present in plasma. When present, factor inhibitors are measured by Bethesda titer units (BU). Titers <5 BUs are classified as low responders, titers >10 BUs as high responders. Responder status influences the approach for clinical treatment. Factor inhibitor assays are ordered in response to clinical impression, and are performed periodically on individuals who have inhibitors and are receiving therapy. During therapy, periodic assays are used, both to manage the dosage and to establish whether a patient is a low or high responder. Low responders maintain titers consistently <5 BUs, while high responders may generate extremely high titers and rapid anamnestic responses to therapy. Assays must also be performed repeatedly during inhibitor suppression therapy.",

Arg534Gln) variant in the F5 gene, commonly referred to as Factor V Leiden, is a genetic risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Heterozygous carriers of this variant have a 6- to 8-fold increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Individuals homozygous for this variant (ie, they have a copy of the variant on each chromosome) have an approximately 80-fold increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Individuals who carry both a *97G>A variant in the F2 gene and Factor V Leiden have an approximately 20-fold increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Risks are likely to be even higher in more complex genotype combinations involving the F2 c.*97G>A variant and Factor V Leiden.1 Additional risk factors include but are not limited to: deficiency of protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III, age, male sex, personal or family history of deep vein thromboembolism, smoking, surgery, prolonged immobilization, malignant neoplasm, tamoxifen treatment, raloxifene treatment, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy, and pregnancy. Management of thrombotic risk and thrombotic events should follow established guidelines and fit the clinical circumstance. This result cannot predict the occurrence or recurrence of a thrombotic event., Genetic coordinators are available for health care providers to discuss results and for information on how to order additional testing, if desired, at 1-800-345-GENE.",

Heterozygotes (with one copy of the mutation) have a sevenfold increased risk, and homozygotes (with two copies) have a 50% to 80% increased risk. These risks are elevated further by additional genetic defects in naturally occurring anticoagulant proteins (eg, deficiencies of protein C, protein S, or antithrombin) and by situations that tend to provoke thrombosis (eg, major surgery, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, malignancy, immobility). Factor V Leiden is also associated with increased risk for multiple pregnancy loss. Factor V Leiden is present in 5% to 7% of the general population and 20% to 40% of individuals with venous thrombosis., The factor V R2 polymorphism is associated with decreased levels of factor V and it significantly increases risk of venous thrombosis in individuals who are heterozygous for the factor V Leiden mutation. Coexistence of the R2 polymorphism with factor V Leiden increases the risk for venous thrombosis approximately to a 16-fold increased risk. The average age of the first thrombotic event is six years younger in individuals who are heterozygous for both factor V Leiden and the R2 polymorphism than in those with factor V Leiden alone. The R2 polymorphism is common in the general population, with one copy (heterozygous) in 10% of individuals. Among patients with venous thrombosis, approximately 12% are heterozygous for the R2 polymorphism. Indications for testing: Venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, peripheral vascular disease (particularly lower extremity occlusive disease), premature stroke or transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction in female smokers under age 50, women with multiple pregnancy loss. Also, family history of venous thrombosis or a relative known to have the factor V Leiden mutation.

Congenital factor VII deficiency is rare (less than one case per 500,000 individuals) and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.6,7 This condition affects both males and females and the prevalence of factor VII deficiency is equal in all ethnic groups.6,7 A few cases of combined congenital factor II, VII, IX, and X factor deficiencies have been reported.6 , Symptoms (homozygotes and double heterozygotes) can include mucosal bleeding, epistaxis, postsurgical and postpartum hemorrhage, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and umbilical cord hemorrhage.6-8 Heterozygotes are usually asymptomatic.8 Factor VII plasma activity <30% may result in excessive bleeding following a traumatic event.6 Spontaneous bleeding similar to that observed in severe hemophilia may occur when the activity is <1%;6,7 however, symptomatology does not always correlate with the degree of factor VII deficiency and some patients with low levels may have no bleeding symptoms at all.6,7 , Diminished factor VII levels can be seen in patients with significant hepatic dysfunction, with oral anticoagulant (coumarin) therapy, and in individuals with vitamin K deficiency.6,7 Low levels can also be observed in patients with specific factor VII inhibitors and in association with homocystinuria and aplastic anemia.7 , High levels of factor VII activity were found to be associated with increased risk for ischemic heart disease events by the Northwick Park Heart Study in 1986;9 however, more recent studies have failed to identify factor VII levels as an independent risk factor for thrombosis.10 A recent consensus conference of the College of American Pathologists on diagnostic issues in thrombophilia did not recommend measurement of factor VII levels for the assessment of thrombotic risk.10",

    "additional_information": "Factor inhibitors (also called circulating anticoagulants or inactivators) are endogenously produced antibodies that interfere with coagulation in vivo or in vitro.6 These inhibitors are frequently specific for their respective coagulation factors. Specific factor inhibitors can be classified as neutralizing or non-neutralizing. Neutralizing inhibitors interact with the functional component of the coagulant protein and may cause clinical bleeding. Non-neutralizing antibodies react with the protein somewhere other than the functional epitopes and may be clinically silent or may result in increased clearance of the factor. Factor inhibitors are not normally present in plasma. When present, factor inhibitors are measured by Bethesda titer units (BU). Titers <5 BUs are generally classified as low responders, titers >10 BUs as high responders. Responder status influences the approach for clinical treatment. Factor inhibitor assays are ordered in response to clinical impression, and are performed periodically on individuals who have inhibitors and are receiving therapy. During therapy, periodic assays are used, both to manage the dosage and to establish whether a patient is a low or high responder. Low responders maintain titers consistently <5 BUs, while high responders may generate extremely high titers and rapid amnestic responses to therapy. Assays must also be performed repeatedly during inhibitor suppression therapy.",

    "additional_information": "Factor VIII is a large glycoprotein cofactor (320 kilodaltons) that is produced mainly in hepatocytes, but also to some extent by liver macrophages, megakaryocytes, and endothelial cells.8,9 Factor VIII circulates in the plasma bound to von Willebrand factor (vWF) at a concentration of approximately 0.1 mg/mL.9 The plasma half-life of factor VIII is short at about 8 to 10 hours.9 Factor VIII deficiency should be suspected when a patient with excessive bleeding has a normal protime (PT) and an extended activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)., Hemophilia A, or classic hemophilia, occurs as the result of congenital deficiency of factor VIII.8,10 Clinical features of hemophilia A are the same as for hemophilia B, which is caused by factor IX deficiency (see Factor IX Activity [086298]). Hemophilia A is the second most common inherited bleeding abnormality (second only to von Willebrand disease), occurring in approximately 1 of every 5000 live male births.8,10 Hemophilia A accounts for approximately 85% of all hemophilia cases.10 This condition is transmitted as an X chromosome-linked hereditary disorder.10 The majority of cases occur in men whose mothers are carriers of the genetic defect. About 30% of factor VIII deficiencies arise in men as spontaneous mutations.8,10 The prevalence of hemophilia A is equal in all ethnic groups.8,10 Female carriers of hemophilia A may rarely present with excessive bleeding.8 Hemophilia symptoms can also occur in female carriers who have a high degree of lyonization of the factor VIII alleles.10 Females with Turner syndrome karyotype XO, can also be symptomatic.10, The severity of hemophilia A can be defined by the level of factor VIII activity.10,11 Severe hemophilia, which represents approximately half the cases, is associated with a factor VIII level <1%. About 10% of cases are moderate with factor VIII levels of 1% to 5% and the remaining 30% to 40% of hemophiliacs have the mild condition with factor VIII levels above >5%., The coagulation factor activity assay used by the majority of clinical laboratories, the one-stage assay (OSA), may underestimate or overestimate the true FVIII activity in up to 30% of patients with mild or moderate (nonsevere) hemophilia A.6,7 Approximately 16% of patients with mild hemophilia A have a normal FVIII OSA, and the correct diagnosis relies on the chromogenic factor VIII assay.6,7 Differences in factor activity measurements between the OSA and chromogenic substrate assay (CSA) in nonsevere hemophilia is called discrepant hemophilia. This occurs in 30% of patients with nonsevere hemophilia A.6,7,12 Such discrepancies may also occur in hemophilia carriers. Although there is no universally accepted definition for what constitutes discrepant hemophilia, the generally accepted criterion is a twofold difference in results between the OSA and CSA. Either OSA results can be greater than CSA or vice versa, depending on the underlying FVIII gene mutation.6,7,12,13 Both possibilities can misclassify hemophilia severity, but the former may result in a missed diagnosis., Discrepant hemophilia A has a genetic basis, generally due to missense mutations that affect the stability of the activated form of FVIII (FVIIIa) or the ability of FVIII to successfully bind the activated form of FIX (FIXa), von Willebrand factor, or thrombin.6,13 Missense mutations clustered in the A1-A2-A3 domain interfaces of the FVIII protein cause reduced stability of FVIIIa, which is more apparent in FVIII activity assays where the FVIIIa is generated during a relatively long (for example, 2-to-10-minute) incubation such as the CSA or the infrequently performed two-stage assay.7,13 In the OSA, FVIII is in the activated form for only a brief period. Missense mutations clustered around thrombin cleavage sites or FIXa binding sites are more readily identified in OSA since the factors are present at physiologic concentrations, unlike the CSA, where factor concentrations are optimized. Also, long long incubation times in the CSA may help to overcome mutations that interfere with binding. The underlying mutations and discrepancies between OSA and CSA are consistent within and between discrepant hemophilia A families., Certain modified recombinant FVIII replacement products demonstrate variable and clinically significant differences in post-infusion recovery (that is, the amount of factor measured vs. the actual concentration present), based on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) reagent used in the OSA or assay methodology.14 Overestimation of post-infusion plasma factor activity can lead to underdosing of the replacement factor and an increased risk of bleeding. Conversely, underestimation of factor activity in the post-infusion sample may lead to overdosing of the replacement factor, which not only has cost implications but also may place the patient at risk for thrombosis. Most recombinant FVIII products may be accurately measured using a chromogenic assay, even when this is performed with a plasma calibrator rather than a product-specific calibrator.15,16, Factor VIII activity may be spuriously decreased on the one stage activity assay in the presence of a lupus anticoagulant. A chromogenic factor activity assay does not demonstrate lupus anticoagulant interference due to the high initial dilution used in the assay and the decreased phospholipid dependence of the assay. Factor VIII levels are elevated at birth and increase during pregnancy.8 Factor VIII is an acute phase reactant with levels that rise during periods of acute stress, following surgery, and in inflammatory conditions.8 Levels can also increase as the result of strenuous exercise or the administration of several drugs including epinephrine, DDAVP, or estrogen (for birth control or hormone replacement therapy). Factor VIII levels can be elevated in a number of clinical conditions including carcinoma, leukemia, liver disease, renal disease, hemolytic anemia, diabetes mellitus, deep vein thrombosis, and myocardial infarction.8 Persistent elevation of factor VIII above 150% is associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis of more than fivefold.9,17 Elevated factor VIII is also associated with an increased risk for recurrence of venous thromboembolism. Risk is graded such that the higher the factor VIII activity, the higher the risk.18 The basis for this increased risk is not well understood as genetic studies of the factor VIII and von Willebrand factor genes failed to identify a genetic basis for this increased risk.9 Values >150% are observed in 20% to 25% of individuals with venous thrombosis or thromboembolism in the absence of other known causes of factor VIII elevation.17",

Cascade screening of all first-degree relatives for lipid levels is considered the most cost-effective lifesaving procedure.

Patients have bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia) and may develop other blood disorders, such as pancytopenia, myelodysplasia, or acute myelogenous leukemia. Other anomalies can also occur, which may include short stature, café-au-lait spots, arm and thumb anomalies, and renal malformations. , There are at least five genes that cause Fanconi anemia, A, B, C, D, and E. Mutations in the FAC gene account for about 14% of all FA diagnoses. The most common FAC mutation is IVS4+4A>T and is found almost exclusively in individuals who are Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ). About 1 in 89 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals are carriers. This analysis detects 99% of FAC mutations for Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. The second most common FAC mutation is 322delG and is found in Northern European populations. 322delG and IVS4+4A>T account for 90% of all FAC mutations. Couples who are both carriers have a one in four risk of having a child with Fanconi anemia. DNA test results must be combined with clinical information for the most accurate interpretation.",

    "additional_information": "Ferritin is found in virtually all cells of the body and serves as the cellular storage repository for iron.2,3 Ferritin is a macromolecule with an average molecular weight of near 440 kD that varies depending on the iron content. Ferritin consists of a protein shell (apoferritin) of 24 subunits surrounding an iron core consisting of up to 4000 ferric iron ions. The majority of ferritin iron stores are found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.  Ferritin is present in small concentration correlates with total-body iron stores, making its measurement valuable for the assessment of disorders of iron metabolism., Low levels of ferritin can be found when iron stores are exhausted, well before the serum iron level has become affected. In the setting of anemia, low serum ferritin is a very specific biomarker for iron deficiency anemia. In fact, there is no clinical situation other than iron deficiency in which extremely low values of serum ferritin are seen; however, some clinical states involving infection or inflammation can cause the ferritin level in the serum of patients with iron deficiency to increase into the normal range. Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant that is thought to play a role in the body's defense against oxidative stress and inflammation. Increased ferritin values can also be observed in malignant disease, including acute leukemia; Hodgkin's disease; and carcinoma of the lung, colon, liver, and prostate. Consequently, serum ferritin in the normal range reflects iron sufficiency only in the absence of these conditions., Patients with a serum ferritin concentration below the lower limit of the reference interval have a very high probability of being iron deficient; however, given the low sensitivity of a low ferritin level (below the lower limit of normal), a higher ferritin cutoff may be more appropriate for screening for potential iron deficiency in some populations.4-7 It is exceedingly uncommon for ferritin levels to exceed 100 ng/mL in patients with iron deficiency.6,7, An elevated ferritin level can result from iron overload due, in part, to increased hepatic ferritin synthesis.8 Iron overload can occur in hemochromatosis, other excess iron storage disorders, and in individuals who have received multiple blood transfusions. Ferritin can also become markedly elevated secondary to obesity, chronic alcohol consumption, steatohepatitis, chronic inflammation, viral hepatitis, and malignancy. The increased prevalence of obesity has likely resulted in the increased incidence of ferritin elevations, as fatty liver may be the most common cause of an elevated serum ferritin.8 Clinical assessment is required to determine whether the serum ferritin elevation is related to hemochromatosis or another underlying liver disease.9 To confirm the diagnosis of hemochromatosis, other iron tests (iron, TIBC), and genetic testing may be performed.",

    "additional_information": "Fibrinogen, also referred to as factor I, is a 340-kilodalton glycoprotein that is produced by the liver.6 Fibrinogen has a plasma half-life of about four days. Proteolytic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin occurs through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.6 Severe fibrinogen deficiency should be considered when a patient with bleeding history has both extended protime (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).7,8  Mild deficiency may not produce prolongation of either the aPTT or PT and, therefore, fibrinogen activity should be measured in individuals with a bleeding tendency even when the aPTT and PT are in the normal reference interval., Congenital afibrinogenemia, a condition associated with the complete absence of fibrinogen, is rare with only about 150 cases reported in the literature.6,7 Fibrinogen deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.7,8 Afibrinogenemia occurs in individuals who are homozygous or doubly heterozygous for mutations. These individuals have infinite protime and aPTT results due to the inability to produce fibrin. Approximately 25% of patients with afibrinogenemia have mild thrombocytopenia.7 , Individuals who are heterozygous for congenital fibrinogen deficiency are usually asymptomatic unless their fibrinogen levels fall to <50 mg/dL.7 Both functional (activity) and antigenic levels are diminished in these individuals.7 Fibrinogen deficiency affects both males and females with a prevalence that is equal in all ethnic groups.7 Acquired deficiencies occur in individuals with significant hepatic dysfunction, renal disease, and after L-asparaginase therapy.6 Diminished levels can also be seen in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or who are undergoing thrombolytic therapy.6 Fibrinogen is one of the major determinants of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and individuals with afibrinogenemia typically have greatly extended sedimentation rates.7 , Individuals with dysfibrinogenemia have fibrinogen that is qualitatively defective with low functional fibrinogen levels (activity) and normal or decreased antigenic levels.6 Congenital dysfibrinogenemia is inherited as an autosomal dominant mutation.6 A number of disfibrinogenemic defects have been identified with a variety of manifestations including abnormal fibrin polymerization, impaired fibrinopeptide release, abnormal fibrin stabilization, and abnormal fibrin clot lysis.6,7 Fibrinogen activity and antigen levels are useful in the diagnosis of dysfibrinogenemia since these individuals often have diminished activity relative to antigen levels.8  Typically, dysfibrinogenemia is associated with an elevated thrombin time and greatly elevated reptilase time., Individuals with afibrinogenemia have a bleeding tendency of varying severity.7 Symptoms often start in early infancy with umbilical cord bleeding, intracerebral hemorrhage, or bleeding at circumcision.6-8 Individuals with afibrinogenemia also suffer from deep muscle and joint bleeding and other mucous membrane bleeding throughout life.6 Women with afibrinogenemia typically do not experience menorrhagia.8 Patients with heterozygous hypofibrinogenemia usually have a minimal history of bleeding with symptoms only observed after major surgery or trauma.6,7 Approximately 50% of individuals with dysfibrinogenemia are asymptomatic suffering neither bleeding nor thrombosis.6,7 These individuals are usually detected when prolonged clotting times are discovered as a result of routine laboratory testing. About one in four will suffer prolonged bleeding after surgery and approximately 20% will have an increased tendency toward thrombosis.6 , A number of clinical and epidemiological studies have revealed a consistent association between elevated fibrinogen levels and increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease;11 however, it remains to be determined whether increased fibrinogen acts as a mediator of arterial thrombosis or simply reflects the inflammation associated with atherosclerosis.11",

    "use": "This assay is used to detect and semi quantitatively measure the presence of FDP in plasma., Fibrinolysis is the enzymatic breakdown of fibrin in blood clots. Plasmin cuts the fibrin mesh at various places, leading to the production of circulating fragments that are cleared by other proteases. Primary fibrinolysis is a normal body process. The fibrinolytic system serves to limit the formation of thrombi and to facilitate healing or recanalization of a vessel with a thrombotic occlusion. Secondary fibrinolysis is the breakdown of clots due to medicine, disorder, or other cause., Under normal conditions, the fibrinolytic process is localized on the fibrin clots because alpha2-antiplasmin and the plasminogen activator inhibitors prevent fibrinolysis from spreading. Fibrin Degradation Products (FDP) that occur are very heterogeneous and include products derived from fibrin, soluble complexes, degradation products from fibrinogen, and from nonstabilized fibrin. The presence FDP of in plasma can provide important information for the diagnosis of hemostatic disorders. An abnormal fibrinolytic and/or fibrinogenolytic activity shown by high levels of FDP in plasma can be found in clinical states, such as eclampsia, carcinoma (promyelocytic leukemia), cardiac and renal disorders, hepatic disorders, fibrinolysis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), following surgery or trauma, and after lytic therapy., Increased FDPs are seen in primary fibrinolysis as well as during fibrin clot breakdown. Elevated FDP levels are a hallmark finding in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Elevated FDP levels are not specific for DIC and increased FDP levels are often seen in primary fibrinolysis, severe liver disease, including alcoholic cirrhosis, eclampsia, during acute thrombotic episodes.",

False positive or false negative results may occur for reasons that include: insufficient information available about rare genetic variants, sex chromosome abnormalities, pseudogene interference, blood transfusions, bone marrow transplantation, somatic or tissue-specific mosaicism, mislabeled samples, or erroneous representation of family relationships. Variants that do not alter an amino acid composition of a protein may be difficult to assess for pathogenicity since they may produce abnormalities in structures not assessed by conventional analysis paradigms, e.g., mRNA expression and processing.1 Interpretation of the clinical significance of gene variations is limited by information about the variant that is available at the time of reporting, and by the quality and quantity of clinical information provided with the sample. As the understanding of human genetic diversity improves, the interpretation of the clinical significance of variants may change., This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by laboratory.

    "methodology": "Nuclear Gene Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and Small Indel Sequencing Assessment: Genomic regions of interest are selected using a custom capture reagent for target enrichment (Twist Bioscience) and sequenced via the Illumina® Novaseq 6000 next generation sequencing platform. Sequencing reads are aligned with the human genome reference GRCh37/hg19 build. Regions of interest include all exons and intron/exon junctions (+/-10 nucleotides) for each gene analyzed. A minimum of 99% of bases in targeted regions are covered at >30X. Analytical sensitivity is estimated to be >99% for single nucleotide variants, >97% for insertions/deletions less than six base pairs, and >95% for insertions/deletions between six and fifteen base pairs. Uncovered regions with known pathogenic variants are sequenced in a targeted manner (List based on ClinVar Database: July 22, 2019 release)., Nuclear Gene Copy Number Variant Assessment: Next Generation Sequencing data used to call SNPs and small indels are assessed with Illumina's DRAGEN (Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics) Bio-IT Platform. Genes listed in ClinVar with intragenic pathogenic deletions are padded with additional intronic probes to allow single exon resolution CNV detection (list based on ClinVar Deletion Database: January 2019 release). For other genes, large deletions (>10 exons) can be detected. The resolution of this analysis can vary depending on region-specific features. Analytical sensitivity is estimated to be >95%., Results Interpretation: Results should be used in the context of available clinical information and should not be used as the sole basis for patient management or treatment. Genetic counseling is recommended. Variants are assessed according to ACMG criteria.2 This report contains interpretation of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants (by ACMG criteria) as well as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) with pathogenic predictions related to the clinical information provided. Variants not reported: (1) variants classified as benign or likely benign by ACMG Criteria; (2) VUS with benign or likely benign predictions; (3) variants related to carrier status. We will reanalyze the data periodically at the clinician's request to allow potential reinterpretation based on new research or evidence.",

    "use": "Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of proteins, is a phosphaturic hormone predominantly produced by bone osteocytes.1-6 Plasma FGF-23 exerts its actions by binding to the FGF receptors on cell membranes. Effective FGF-23 binding to these cell surface receptors requires that the cell membrane also contain the transmembrane protein, Klotho.1,7-10 FGF-23 inhibits phosphate reabsorption by suppressing Na/Pi cotransporter activity in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney. In addition, FGF-23 suppresses intestinal phosphate absorption by inhibiting 1-α-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of calcifediol to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D.1-3 FGF-23 also possibly inhibits parathyroid hormone (PTH) synthesis and secretion.1-9 In healthy individuals, low levels of FGF-23 are detected in the circulation, and FGF-23 secretion rises with increased phosphorus intake and increased calcitriol levels.11, Elevated plasma FGF-23 activity has been associated with several hypophosphatemic diseases characterized by impaired renal phosphate reabsorption and rickets/osteomalacia.4,5,8 Mutations in FGF-23 that render the protein resistant to proteolytic cleavage lead to increased FGF-23 activity and the renal phosphate loss found in autosomal-dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR). X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH)4,5,8 and autosomal-recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) are due to mutations in PHEX and dentin matrix protein 1, respectively. Both disorders are characterized by overproduction of FGF-23 by bone osteocytes. In tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), an acquired disorder of renal phosphate wasting associated with tumors, typically of mesenchymal origin; phosphatonins produced by the tumor promote renal phosphate wasting. FGF-23 is the most common phosphatonin found in patients with TIO.4 Patients with TIO share similar biochemical and skeletal phenotypes with patients who have ADHR, ARHR, and XLH.4, FGF-23 levels increase dramatically as renal function declines in chronic kidney disease (CKD) as the body attempts to overcome persistent phosphate retention.1,3 FGF-23 elevation is thought to play a role in causing the disordered bone and mineral metabolism seen in CKD patients.1,3 FGF-23 levels increase in parallel with the decline in renal function well before a significant increase in serum phosphate concentration or PTH occur.1,3 Increased FGF-23 levels lead to reduced renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and to hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone.2 Prospective studies have demonstrated that elevated FGF-23 levels predict faster disease progression in CKD patients not on dialysis and increased mortality in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and patients with renal transplants.1,12 FGF-23 may predict future development of refractory hyperparathyroidism and cardiovascular events in CKD patients2,13 and is thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of post-transplant hypophosphatemia in kidney transplant recipients.2",

Make short 5 mm “in-and-out” motions until you see material coming into the hub of the needle. When you start to see material in the hub, stop, release negative pressure on the syringe, and pull out to make the slides. Do not aspirate material into the syringe or dilute with blood or saline. This interferes with making good direct smears. (See preparation of slides below.) If you do not see any material at all in the hub or syringe, continue the short 5 mm strokes until you have done 15 to 20 strokes. Pull out and attempt to express material on slides (see below). Repeat the above procedure again using a clean needle for a second pass (and more passes if needed). Many physicians use no local anesthesia.

Fluoxetine is excreted in the urine primarily as inactive metabolites. Renal impairment does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics, although alcohol-induced cirrhosis does prolong the half-life. , The elimination half-life is long: one to four days for fluoxetine and 7 to 10 days for norfluoxetine. Because of the long half-life, the drug can be administered once daily, efficacy is unaffected by an occasional missed dose, and abrupt termination of therapy results in gradual cessation of effects.

    "additional_information": "Folates are compounds of pteroylglutamic acid (PGA) that function as coenzymes in metabolic reactions involving the transfer of single-carbon units from a donor to a recipient compound. Folate, with vitamin B12, is essential for DNA synthesis, which is required for normal red blood cell maturation.2 Humans obtain folate from dietary sources including fruits, green and leafy vegetables, yeast, and organ meats.3 Folate is absorbed through the small intestine and stored in the liver., Low folate intake, malabsorption as a result of gastrointestinal diseases, pregnancy, and drugs such as phenytoin are causes of folate deficiency.4 Folate deficiency is also associated with chronic alcoholism.5 Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency impair DNA synthesis, causing macrocytic anemias. These anemias are characterized by abnormal maturation of red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow, the presence of megaloblasts, and decreased red blood cell survival.2,  Since both folate and vitamin B12 deficiency can cause macrocytic anemia, appropriate treatment depends on the differential diagnosis of the deficiency. A serum folate concentration <3 ng/mL is considered to represent clinical deficiency by the World Health Organization and numerous subsequent clinical studies.6,7 Serum folate measurement provides an early index of folate status3; however, folate is much more concentrated in red blood cells than in serum so the red blood cell folate measurement more closely reflects tissue stores.5,8  Erythrocytes incorporate folate as they are formed, and levels remain constant throughout the life span of the cell. RBC folate levels are less sensitive to short-term dietary effects than are serum folate levels. Red blood cell folate concentration is considered the most reliable indicator of folate status.3, Low serum folate during pregnancy has been associated with neural tube defects in the fetus.9,10, In the 1990s mandatory increased fortification of enriched cereal-grain products along with the requirement of folate-related health and nutrient content claims on food and dietary supplement products significantly increased the folic acid content of the US food supply.11-13 Several reports have shown that serum folate concentrations have increased in the general US population since these measures were implemented.11-13",

    "additional_information": "FSH is a glycoprotein consisting of two subunits (α- and β-chains). Its molecular weight is approximately 32,000 daltons. FSH together with LH (luteinizing hormone), belongs to the gonadotropin family. FSH and LH regulate and stimulate the growth and function of the gonads (ovaries and testes) synergistically.3, FSH and LH are released in pulses from the gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary. The levels of the circulating hormones are controlled by steroid hormones via negative feedback to the hypothalamus. In the ovaries, FSH, together with LH, stimulates the growth and maturation of the follicle and hence also the biosynthesis of estrogens in the follicles., In women, the gonadotropins act within the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary regulating circuit to control the menstrual cycle.1,4 The FSH level shows a peak at midcycle, although this is less marked than with LH. Due to changes in ovarian function and reduced estrogen secretion, high FSH concentrations occur during menopause.1 The determination of FSH in conjunction with LH is utilized for the following indications: congenital diseases with chromosome aberrations, polycystic ovaries (PCO), amenorrhea (causes), and menopausal syndrome., In men, FSH serves to induce spermatogonium development. Determination of the FSH concentration is used in the elucidation of dysfunctions within the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonads system. Depressed gonadotropin levels in men occur in azoospermia.1,3,5,6",

    "additional_information": "Fragile X syndrome (OMIM 309550) is the most common known form of inherited mental retardation, affecting 16 to 25 of 100,000 males. Prevalence among females is approximately half what is reported for males. In almost every case the disorder arises from an expansion of a CGG repeat polymorphism in the 5′ untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. The expansion commonly occurs in the maternal line of transmission. The normal repeat range is defined as 54 repeats and fewer. Patients with 55 to 200 CGG repeats are regarded as premutation carriers. Premutations are unstable and prone to further expansion in the next generation, such that females with premutations are at high risk of having a child with a full mutation (>200 repeats). The high end of the normal range (45-54 repeats) is considered a gray zone. Gray zone carriers are unlikely to have children with full mutations, but subsequent generations may be at risk. The full mutation is associated with methylation of the FMR1 promoter region that abrogates gene expression and elicits the fragile X phenotype of mental retardation/developmental delay, commonly with characteristic facial and gonadal features. Premutation carriers will not exhibit the features. Females may experience primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), while men (and, less commonly, women) older than 50 may exhibit an ataxia and tremor phenotype (FXTAS) with similarities to parkinsonism",

Albumin has a much lower binding affinity for testosterone but binds a significant portion of the total testosterone because albumin is present at much higher plasma concentrations than SHBG.2,4 The rapid dissociation of “weakly bound” testosterone from albumin, together with a relatively long transit time of albumin through target tissue capillary beds, result in the availability of essentially all albumin-bound testosterone for steroid-receptor interaction.4 The sum of the free- and albumin-bound testosterone is often referred to as bioavailable testosterone. The concentration of testosterone in the various free and bound forms is essentially a function of total testosterone concentration and the relative concentrations of SHBG and albumin. It can be predicted that increased SHBG will decrease the concentration of both free and bioavailable testosterone for a given total testosterone concentration. The free androgen index can be used to estimate physiologically active testosterone.2,3 This index is calculated as the ratio of total testosterone divided by SHBG (both expressed in the same units) and multiplied by 100 to yield numerical results comparable in free testosterone concentration.2,5-7",

    "additional_information": "Immunoglobulin molecules consist of two identical heavy chains (α, δ, ε, γ, or μ) which define the immunoglobulin class and two identical light chains (κ or λ). Each light chain is covalently linked to a heavy chain and the two heavy chains are linked covalently at the hinge region. In healthy individuals, the majority of light chains in serum exists in this form, bound to heavy chain; however, low levels of free light chain (FLC) are found in serum of normal individuals due to the overproduction and secretion of FLC by the plasma cells. While the molecular weight of both light chains is approximately 22.5 kilodaltons, in serum, κ free light chain (κ-FLC) exists primarily as a monomer and λ free light chain (λ-FLC) as a covalently-linked dimer with a molecular weight of approximately 45 kilodaltons. This will lead to a differential glomerular filtration rate for κ-FLC and λ-FLC and may explain the observed ratio of κ-FLC to λ-FLC of 0.625 in serum compared to the ratio of bound κ to λ of 2.0., The laboratory will perform FLC analysis on urine, but a serum sample is preferred for many reasons. Analogous to glucose metabolism, FLC spill into the urine only after the tubular reabsorptive capacity is exceeded. Thus, the serum FLC ratio has been shown to be abnormal in patients with monoclonal gammopathy despite normal urine FLC ratios or normal urine immunofixation. Serum tests are also more sensitive for the detection of residual monoclonal FLC after treatment and for the early detection of monoclonal FLC after relapse in patients with monoclonal gammopathy., FLC levels in urine are normally low. In a healthy kidney, the tubular cells selectively reabsorb all FLC so their presence in urine is probably due to secretion into the urinary tract. , The appearance of higher levels of polyclonal FLC in urine may be indicative of kidney or autoimmune disease. An abnormal urine FLC ratio may be indicative of malignant lymphoproliferative disease such as multiple myeloma. The monoclonal urinary FLC associated with lymphoid malignancy is called a Bence-Jones protein.",

    "additional_information": "Fructosamine is found in the plasma of both normal and diabetic individuals. “Fructosamine” is the term used to describe proteins that have been glycated (ie, are derivatives of the nonenzymatic reaction product of glucose and albumin). It has been advocated as an alternative test to hemoglobin A1c for the monitoring of long-term diabetic control. Fructosamine and hemoglobin A1c do not measure exactly the same thing, since fructosamine has a shorter half-life and appears to be more sensitive to short-term variations in glucose levels; however, this is not necessarily a disadvantage. Fructosamine is clearly superior in patients with abnormal hemoglobins because of the interference of abnormal hemoglobins in the anion-exchange chromatography methods for Hb A1c. Published reference interval for apparently healthy subjects between age 20 and 60 is 205−285 μmol/L and in a poorly-controlled diabetic population is 228−563 μmol/L with a mean of 396 μmol/L.",

    "additional_information": "Blood: Fungemia can be a complication of venous or arterial catheterization, hyperalimentation, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and therapy with steroids, antineoplastic drugs, radiation, or broad spectrum antimicrobial agents. Intravenous drug abusers are prone to Candida endocarditis. Although many fungal species, including Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, and Cryptococcus neoformans are recoverable from blood cultures, the most common cause of fungemia is Candida albicans followed by other Candida sp, including Candida glabrata. Fungemia represents a failure of the host defense system. Fungemia may be precipitated by contamination of an indwelling catheter or, in the critically ill and immunocompromised patient, contamination of the gastrointestinal and less frequently the urinary tract.1 In a review of 356 patients with neoplastic disease, Candida sp was recovered in 7% of neutropenic patients. , In the potentially immunocompromised host, a temperature of 38.5°C (101°F) for more than two hours, which is not associated with the administration of a pyrogenic drug (chemotherapy), indicates the presence of infection until proven otherwise. In these patients, characteristic signs and symptoms are frequently absent. A careful physical examination, including mouth, anus, and genitalia, may reveal the site of infection. Therapy must be instituted as soon as appropriate specimens are collected. Most infections in these patients are caused by gram-negative organisms (eg, E coli, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp) and by S aureus; however, fungi and other usually nonpathogenic organisms must be considered significant.2 , Rarely, blastospores (budding yeast structures) and pseudohyphae can be seen by examination of Wright-stained venous peripheral blood smears. This technique may allow early diagnosis and therapy before culture results are available.3 , Eye: The more common causes of keratomycosis include Fusarium solani, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Curvularia sp, Aspergillus flavus, other species of Aspergillus, Penicillium, Paecilomyces, Fusarium, and many other species.4 A keratomycosis-like clinical presentation may also be encountered caused by Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium fortuitum. Keratomycosis is a rare complication of contact lens use.5 , Sinus: Fungal sinusitis has been increasingly recognized in otherwise healthy teenagers who often present with a history of recurrent sinusitis, asthma, and/or polyps. At surgery, material is consistently described as thick peanut butter-like or pistachio pudding-like. Dematiaceous fungi are the most common cause. , Skin: Candida sp may colonize skin. Clinical diagnosis of Candida infection involves consideration of predisposing factors such as occlusion, maceration altered cutaneous barrier function. Signs of Candida infection include bright erythema, fragile papulopustules, and satellite lesions.6 Patients with defects in T-lymphocyte responses, such as AIDS patients or individuals being treated with antineoplastic drugs, are especially susceptible to many fungal infections including superficial mycoses.7,8 See tables. , Diagnosis, Superficial Mycoses, Piedra, Specimen of Choice, Hair, Tinea nigra, Specimen of Choice, Skin scraping, Pityriasis versicolor, Specimen of Choice, Skin scraping, Dermatomycoses (Cutaneous Mycoses), Onychomycosis, Specimen of Choice, Nail scraping, Tinea capitis, Specimen of Choice, Hair (black dot), Tinea corporis, Specimen of Choice, Skin scraping, Tinea pedis, Specimen of Choice, Skin scraping, Tinea cruris, Specimen of Choice, Skin scraping, Candidiasis, Thrush, Specimen of Choice, Scraping of oral white patches, Diaper dermatitis, Specimen of Choice, Scraping of pustules at margin, Paronychia, Specimen of Choice, Scraping skin around nail, Cutaneous candidiasis, Specimen of Choice, Scraping of pustules at margin, Erosio interdigitalis blastomycetia (coinfection with gram-negative rods), Specimen of Choice, Scrapings of interdigital space, (routine culture also), Congenital candidiasis, Specimen of Choice, Scraping of scales, pustules and cutaneous debris, cultures of umbilical stump, mouth, urine, and stool, Mucocutaneous candidiasis, Specimen of Choice, Scraping of affected area, Diagnosis, Specimen of Choice, Superficial Mycoses, Piedra, Hair, Tinea nigra, Skin scraping, Pityriasis versicolor, Skin scraping, Dermatomycoses (Cutaneous Mycoses), Onychomycosis, Nail scraping, Tinea capitis, Hair (black dot), Tinea corporis, Skin scraping, Tinea pedis, Skin scraping, Tinea cruris, Skin scraping, Candidiasis, Thrush, Scraping of oral white patches, Diaper dermatitis, Scraping of pustules at margin, Paronychia, Scraping skin around nail, Cutaneous candidiasis, Scraping of pustules at margin, Erosio interdigitalis blastomycetia (coinfection with gram-negative rods), Scrapings of interdigital space, (routine culture also), Congenital candidiasis, Scraping of scales, pustules and cutaneous debris, cultures of umbilical stump, mouth, urine, and stool, Mucocutaneous candidiasis, Scraping of affected area, Diagnosis, Systemic Mycoses, Aspergillosis, Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Biopsy (lung), Blastomycosis, Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Skin scrapings, Abscess drainage (pus), Urine, Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Candidiasis, Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Blood, Cerebrospinal fluid, Urine, Stool, Coccidioidomycosis, Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Cerebrospinal fluid, Urine, Skin scrapings, Abscess drainage (pus), Cryptococcosis, Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Cerebrospinal fluid, Sputum, Abscess drainage (pus), Skin scraping, Urine, Mycormycosis / phycomycosis / zygomycosis, Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Biopsy (lung), Paracoccidioidomycosis, (South American blastomycosis), Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Skin scrapings, Mucosal scrapings, Biopsy (lymph nodes), Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Subcutaneous Mycoses, Chromomycosis, Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Skin scrapings, Biopsy (skin), Drainage (pus), Maduromycosis (mycetoma), Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Abscess drainage, Biopsy (lesion), Granules, Sporotrichosis, Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Drainage (pus), Abscess drainage, Biopsy (skin, lymph node), Diagnosis, Specimen of Choice, in Order of Usefulness, Systemic Mycoses, Aspergillosis, Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Biopsy (lung), Blastomycosis, Skin scrapings, Abscess drainage (pus), Urine, Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Candidiasis, Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Blood, Cerebrospinal fluid, Urine, Stool, Coccidioidomycosis, Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Cerebrospinal fluid, Urine, Skin scrapings, Abscess drainage (pus), Cryptococcosis, Cerebrospinal fluid, Sputum, Abscess drainage (pus), Skin scraping, Urine, Mycormycosis / phycomycosis / zygomycosis, Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Biopsy (lung), Paracoccidioidomycosis, (South American blastomycosis), Skin scrapings, Mucosal scrapings, Biopsy (lymph nodes), Sputum, Bronchial aspirate, Subcutaneous Mycoses, Chromomycosis, Skin scrapings, Biopsy (skin), Drainage (pus), Maduromycosis (mycetoma), Abscess drainage, Biopsy (lesion), Granules, Sporotrichosis, Drainage (pus), Abscess drainage, Biopsy (skin, lymph node), Hair: The leading agent of tinea capitis in the United States is Trichophyton tonsurans. Other dermatophytes such as T violaceum, T mentagrophytes, and Microsporum canis are also recovered routinely. Unlike at the beginning of the 20th century, M audouinii is rarely seen. , Nails: Nail disease can be caused by dermatophytes and nondermatophytes. The leading cause of nail infection is Trichophyton rubrum, but it is not unusual to find T mentagrophytes and T tonsurans. Recovery of dermatophytes from nail can be difficult and careful cleansing, scraping of the diseased nail, and collecting debris under the nail is required. Attributing nail disease to nondermatophytes is more problematic. Fungi such as Fusarium, Scopulariopsis, and some aspergilli are routinely associated with disease, however, Chrysosporium, Paecilomyces, Trichoderma and others may likely represent environmental contamination unless repeatedly isolated in the absence of other pathogens. , Sputum: Deeply coughed sputum, transtracheal aspirate, bronchial washing or brushing, or deep tracheal aspirate are preferred specimens. Oncology patients, transplant patients, and patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are particularly prone to infection with fungi.8 , Primary fungal pulmonary infections include Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Blastomyces dermatitidis. The incidence is largely related to geographic exposure and cases can occur in seemingly normal hosts. Numbers of reports of opportunistic fungal pulmonary infections due to a variety of etiologic agents that are ubiquitous in the environment are being published. Definitive diagnosis depends upon the presence of clinical signs of pulmonary infection, a chest x-ray revealing abnormality such as granuloma; laboratory isolation of a potentially significant organism from a suitable specimen; histologic documentation of tissue invasion by the isolated organism. A list of etiologic agents of pulmonary fungal disease has been compiled.9 In practice a diagnosis sufficient for therapy can frequently be established by observation of hyphae, pseudohyphae, spherules, or yeast cells in tissue sections; recovery of the organism from a normally sterile site; repeated isolation of the same suspect organism from the same or different sites; seroconversion (ie, the development of an immune response to the suspected organism).10 Candida and Aspergillus sp are the most frequently isolated fungal organisms; however, they are frequently present as the result of contamination from the patient's normal flora or airborne sources. Their presence may represent colonization rather than invasion. Recovery of Candida from blood is a major adjunct to definitive diagnosis. Even without invasion Aspergillus may cause IgE mediated asthma, allergic alveolitis cell mediated hypersensitivity, mucoid impaction, and bronchocentric granulomatosis.11 Fungal tracheobronchitis has recently been recognized as a pseudomembranous form involving the circumference of the bronchial wall or as multiple or discrete plaques. The plaques or pseudomembranes are composed of necrotic tissue exudate and fungal hyphae.12 , Stool: Candida can be isolated in up to 30% of oropharyngeal cultures and 65% of stool cultures; thus, it is a common saprophyte.13 Neonates and adults may develop watery diarrhea due to intestinal overgrowth by yeast that readily responds to specific therapy. Candida may become disseminated in patients with leukopenia, immunosuppressive therapy, AIDS, corticosteroid therapy, phagocytic defects, hyperalimentation, use of broad spectrum antibiotics, and oral contraceptives. Travelers in endemic areas with poor sanitation have also experienced intestinal overgrowth with Candida, although the specific mechanism causing diarrhea is unknown.14 , Candida-associated diarrhea is predominantly of the secretory type, characterized by frequent watery stools, usually without blood, mucus, tenesmus, or abdominal pain.15 Overgrowth of Candida sp should be considered when evaluating Clostridium difficile negative cases of antibiotic-associated colitis.16 , Urine: Asymptomatic funguria often clears spontaneously; however, candiduria with >15,000 colony forming units/mL of urine and with such evidence of dissemination as elevated serum precipitin antibody titers, is associated with increased mortality.17 Patients with candiduria may or may not have candidemia; positive urine culture for fungi often may be followed by positive blood culture for fungi. Ascending infections occur in patients with diabetes, prolonged antimicrobial therapy, or following instrumentation. Urinary obstruction due to “fungus balls” may occur in diabetes and following renal transplantation. Candiduria associated with hematogenous infections is observed in patients with granulocytopenia, corticosteroid therapy, and with immunosuppression. The source is frequently the gastrointestinal tract or indwelling catheters particular with hyperalimentation.18 A blood fungus culture is useful to define invasive disease; however, proof of invasive Candida infection requires direct cystoscopic or operative visualization, fungus balls, pyelonephritis, or histological evidence of mucosa invasion. Urine is a useful specimen for culture in cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, and candidiasis. The incidence of genitourinary fungal infections is increasing. They are usually associated with broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, corticosteroid therapy, underlying general debility, and AIDS. In addition to Candida, opportunistic pathogens in the genitourinary tract include Aspergillus and Cryptococcus. Endemic pathogens such as Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Coccidioides are also encountered.19 , Mold spores are common in the environment and it is not uncommon for saprophytic environmental fungi to be recovered from respiratory and skin specimens.",

Clinical history, patient’s age, and presence of comorbidities (such as atopic dermatitis) must be incorporated into the diagnostic determination., If a food is tolerated in the patient’s diet on a regular basis, detectable food specific IgE does not confirm allergy to that food. In population studies, many individuals produce IgE to α-Gal but do not have allergic symptoms.7 If allergy to a specific food is suspected based on clinical history, an undetectable food specific IgE does not exclude allergy to that food., Alpha-gal allergies are similar to pork-cat syndrome. Pork-cat syndrome usually elicits an immediate allergic response, while a true α-Gal allergy typically features a delayed allergic reaction of 3 to 8 hours after ingestion of the allergen.8, Total IgE levels are of value in assessing potential α-Gal allergy because some cases are non-atopic and have low total IgE.9,10",

    "additional_information": "In early studies of patients treated with Cetuximab, it was observed that up to 15 percent of patients reacted upon first exposure with severe and sometimes fatal anaphylaxis.11,12 Further analysis revealed that most of the affected patients lived in the southeast region of the United States and that many of these patients later also reacted to the ingestion of red meat.11,13-16 These findings led to the identification of α-Gal sIgE as the potentiating factor.17 Epidemiological data revealed that bites by the tick Amblyomma americanum or Lone Star Tick11,13 in the USA, later also by Ixodes species in other continents,18 resulted in sensitization to α-Gal., While the prevalence of allergy to α-Gal in the United States is not fully known,18,19 researchers have observed that it occurs mostly in people living in the Southeast region of the United States and certain areas of New York, New Jersey and New England.11,14,19 It is unclear exactly how the tick bites induce the production of α-Gal sIgE, but a correlation with a history of multiple bites and persistent local reactions has been reported.15,20 Efforts to understand the physiology of this syndrome are confounded by the fact that African patients with parasitic disorders and a high prevalence of α-Ga sIgE positivity appear not to suffer from any allergic consequences.21, The discovery of α-Gal allergy occurred only recently, in large part, because of the unique nature of this syndrome. In contrast to the typical rapid onset of most food allergies, a typical α-Gal sIgE mediated allergic reaction has a delayed onset, occurring 3 to 8 hours after the consumption of the food.22  This lack of chronologic proximity of the reaction to the ingestion of the causative agent has led many of these cases to be wrongly considered as idiopathic anaphylaxis in the past.4-6 After the delayed onset, the allergic response to α-Gal is similar to that seen for other IgE-mediated food; hives, angioedema, gastrointestinal upset, and possible anaphylaxis. Respiratory distress associated with α-Gal allergy can be particularly harmful to those with asthma.23 In some patients, cofactors such as exercise and alcohol have been implicated as contributing factors., α-Gal is a carbohydrate present on glycoproteins in non-primate mammals and certain invertebrates, but not in humans, Old World monkeys or apes.22 It is not expressed in poultry, seafood, and fish. α-Gal is present in many mammalian foods, including meat, internal organs (such as kidney or tripe), milk and other dairy, and gelatin.24,25 Allergic reaction after ingestion of sweet gums containing gelatins (e.g. Haribo®) have been reported.26 α-Gal is present in the anticancer drug cetuximab, intravenous fluid replacements Gelofusine and Haemaccel, anticoagulant drugs derived from porcine intestine and in replacement heart valves derived from porcine tissue.17,25,27-29, α-Gal IgE levels greater than or equal to 2.0 IU/ml or >2% of the total IgE makes the diagnosis very likely.10",

    "additional_information": "Galectin-3 is member of the protein family known as galectins. Galectins bind to certain carbohydrates via specific carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs). Galectin-3 is a 29 to 35 kDa chimera-type galectin − the only member of the galectin family with an extended N-terminal domain constituted of tandem repeats of short amino acid segments (a total of 110-130 amino acids) linked to a single C-terminal CRD of about 130 amino acids., Galectin-3 interacts with carbohydrates, such as N-acetyllactosamine (LacNac), certain cell surface receptors (such as macrophage CD11b/CD18) and extracellular receptors (such as collagen). Galectins play an important and complex role in intracellular pathways and disease mechanisms. Under certain circumstances, galectin-3 is secreted in the extracellular matrix and galectin-3 can be measured in plasma or serum of healthy individuals. Galectin-3 has been implicated in a variety of biological processes important in heart failure including myofibroblast proliferation, fibrogenesis, tissue repair, cardiac remodeling and inflammation. Experimental data implicate galectin-3 in heart failure development and progression and administration of galectin-3 can induce cardiac fibrosis and reduced ejection fraction in animals. Blockade of galectin-3 prevents organ fibrosis following inflammation and organ damage., The experimental data are corroborated by several independent clinical studies that indicated that elevated levels of galectin-3 (>17.8 ng/mL) are associated with an increased near-term or long-term risk for hospitalization or death (p<0.05 after adjusting for pertinent covariates). Galectin-3 levels reflect the presence of specific underlying disease processes and are not affected by the degree of decompensation. Hence galectin-3 levels, once elevated, remain generally constant and do not fluctuate with signs and symptoms of heart failure. Although certain medical and device treatments appear to be effective in patients with elevated galectin-3, galectin-3 plasma levels are generally not affected by these treatments., Galectin-3 and natriuretic peptides are measures of separate and distinct biological processes. Each marker provides independent and complementary information on the status and prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure.",

Approximately 80% of GISTs have a mutation in c-KIT and 5% to 10% of GISTs have a mutation in PDGFRA. PDGFRA mutations are mutually exclusive with c-KIT mutations but activate similar signal transduction pathways that support GIST oncogenesis. The location of c-KIT and PDGFRA mutations in GISTs is associated with the site of origin, histological phenotype, and treatment response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI, such as imatinib and sunitinib). Patients with mutations in c-KIT exon 11 have been shown to have significantly better response rates to imatinib treatment when compared with patients who have the c-KIT exon 9 mutations or no mutation. Patients with mutations in c-KIT exon 9 may benefit from dose escalation depending on tolerance. Secondary mutations usually occur in c-KIT kinase domains in patients after imatinib treatment resulting in resistance to this drug. Most known mutations in the PDGFRA gene are associated with imatinib response with the exception of D842V mutation. In a subset of intestinal high-risk GISTs lacking c-KIT/PDGFRA mutations, 7% have a mutation in BRAF.

    "additional_information": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal  tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, located mostly in the stomach (60%) and small intestine (35%). Approximately 80% of GISTs have a mutation in c-KIT and 5% to 10% of GISTs have a mutation in PDGFRA. PDGFRA mutations are mutually exclusive with c-KIT mutations but active similar signal transduction pathways that support GIST oncogenesis. The location of c-KIT and PDGFRA mutations in GISTs is associated with the site of origin, histological phenotype, and treatment response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI, such as imatinib and sunitinib). Patients with mutations in c-KIT exon 11 have been shown to have significantly better response rates to imatinib treatment when compared with patients who have the c-KIT exon 9 mutations or no mutation. Patients with mutations in c-KIT exon 9 may benefit from dose escalation depending on tolerance. Secondary mutations usually occur in c-KIT kinase domains in patients after imatinib treatment resulting in resistance to this drug. Other TKI inhibitors, such as sunitinib and sorafenib, could be used as a replacement drug for selected mutations. Most known mutations in the PDGFRA gene are associated with imatinib response with the exception of D842V mutation. In a subset of intestinal high-risk GISTs lacking c-KIT/PDGFRA mutations, 7% have a mutation in BRAF. Kinase inhibitors targeting BRAF may be effective therapeutic options in this molecular GIST subset.",

Infants, especially with tremor, cyanosis, convulsions, and respiratory distress should have stat glucose, particularly if there is maternal diabetes, postmaturity, asphyxia, hemolytic disease of the newborn, or possible sepsis. Babies too large or small for gestational age should also have glucose in the first 24 hours of life.

    "additional_information": "Recent evidence revealed a diurnal variation in FPG, with mean FPG higher in the morning than in the afternoon, indicating that many cases of undiagnosed diabetes would be missed in patients seen in the afternoon. Glucose concentrations decrease ex vivo with time in whole blood because of glycolysis. The rate of glycolysis, reported to average 5% to 7% [~0.6 mmol/L (10 mg/dL)] per hour, varies with the glucose concentration, temperature, white blood cell count, and other factors. Glycolysis can be attenuated by inhibition of enolase with sodium fluoride (2.5 mg fluoride/mL of blood) or, less commonly, lithium iodoacetate (0.5 mg/mL of blood). These reagents can be used alone or, more commonly, with anticoagulants such as potassium oxalate, EDTA, citrate, or lithium heparin. Although fluoride maintains long-term glucose stability, the rate of decline of glucose in the first hour after sample collection in tubes with and without fluoride is virtually identical. (Note that leukocytosis will increase glycolysis even in the presence of fluoride if the white cell count is very high). After four hours, the glucose concentration is stable in whole blood for 72 hours at room temperature in the presence of fluoride. In separated, nonhemolyzed, sterile serum without fluoride, the glucose concentration is stable for fourteen days at 25°C and 4°C., Glucose can be measured in whole blood, serum, or plasma, but plasma is recommended for diagnosis. The molality of glucose (ie, amount of glucose per unit water mass) in whole blood and plasma is identical. Although red blood cells are essentially freely permeable to glucose (glucose is taken up by facilitated transport), the concentration of water (kg/L) in plasma is ~11% higher than that of whole blood. Therefore, glucose concentrations in plasma are ~11% higher than whole blood if the hematocrit is normal. Glucose concentrations in heparinized plasma are reported to be 5% lower than in serum. The reasons for the latter difference are not apparent but may be attributable to the shift in fluid from erythrocytes to plasma caused by anticoagulants. The glucose concentrations during an OGTT in capillary blood are significantly higher than those in venous blood [mean of 1.7 mmol/L (30 mg/dL), equivalent to 20% to 25%], but the mean difference in fasting samples is only 0.1 mmol/L (2 mg/dL)., Although methods for glucose analysis exhibit low imprecision at the diagnostic decision limits of 7.0 mmol/L [(126 mg/dL), fasting] and 11.1 mmol/L [(200 mg/dL), postglucose load], the relatively large intraindividual biological variability (CVs of ~5% to 7%) may produce classification errors. On the basis of biological variation, glucose analysis should have analytical imprecision <3.4%, bias <2.6%, and total error <8.0%.1,2, Like a fasting glucose level >125 mg/dL, a two-hour postprandial glucose >200 mg/dL is virtually diagnostic of diabetes mellitus and obviates the need for a glucose tolerance test. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is not necessary in the setting of sufficiently high fasting and two-hour postprandial results. , Other causes of high glucose (serum or plasma) include nonfasting specimen; recent or current IV infusions of glucose; stress states such as myocardial infarct,5 brain damage, CVA,6 convulsive episodes, trauma, general anesthesia; Cushing disease; acromegaly; pheochromocytoma; glucagonoma; severe liver disease; pancreatitis; drugs (thiazide and other diuretics, corticoids, many others are reported to affect glucose). , The danger of hypoglycemia (low glucose) is lack of a steady supply of glucose to the brain (neuroglycopenia). , Causes of low glucose: Excess insulin, including rare insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia, surreptitious insulin injection, and sulfonylurea use; glycolysis in specimens overheated or old; serum permitted to stand on clot in red-top tube for chemistry profile. Very prompt removal of plasma and analysis is needed in cases of marked leukocytosis. Hypoglycemia should be confirmed by specimens drawn in fluoride tubes (gray-top tubes). , With hypoglycemia, symptoms must be correlated with plasma glucose. , Three major groups of hypoglycemia are defined: reactive, fasting, and surreptitious. The reactive group includes alimentary hyperinsulinism, prediabetic, endocrine deficiency, and idiopathic functional groups.7 Postprandial hypoglycemia may occur after gastrointestinal surgery, and is described with hereditary fructose intolerance, galactosemia, and leucine sensitivity. , • Pancreatic islet cell tumors (insulinomas) − cause hypoglycemia in fasting individuals or after exercise. Measurement of simultaneous glucose, C-peptide, and insulin levels at the time of spontaneous hypoglycemia help to differentiate insulinoma from other conditions. The glucose:insulin ratio is useful in the diagnosis of insulinoma: insulin levels inappropriately increased for plasma glucose. An intravenous tolbutamide test with plasma glucose and serum insulin determinations may be used for evaluation of insulin-secreting islet cell tumors. The test is positive in approximately 75% of patients with these tumors.7 Glucagon and leucine stimulation tests are less frequently utilized. , • Extrapancreatic tumors−rare bulky fibromas, sarcomas, mesotheliomas, and carcinomas, including hepatoma and adrenal tumors, • Adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), including congenital adrenal hyperplasia, • Hypopituitarism, isolated growth hormone or ACTH deficiency , • Starvation, malabsorption−but starvation does not cause hypoglycemia in normal persons, • Drugs including insulin (see above), oral hypoglycemic agents, and alcoholism, especially with starvation. Ethanolism is a common cause of hypoglycemia. Other drugs can depress glucose levels., • Liver damage, including fulminant hepatic necrosis (hepatitis, toxicity), and severe congestive failure, • Tumor-induced hypoglycemia appears to be caused by increased production of an insulin-like substance (insulin-like growth factor II) by the tumor. This substance induces increased utilization of glucose by the peripheral tissues and the tumor, and impairs the counterregulatory effect of growth hormone by suppressing growth hormone secretion.8,9, Infancy and childhood: Infants with tremor, convulsions and/or respiratory distress should have stat glucose, particularly in the presence of maternal diabetes, hemolytic disease of the newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis); babies too large or small for gestational age should also have glucose level measured in the first 24 hours of life. A large number of entities relate to neonatal hypoglycemia, including glycogen storage diseases, galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance, ketotic hypoglycemia of infancy, fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency, carnitine deficiency (a treatable disease presenting as Reye syndrome), and nesidioblastosis.",
