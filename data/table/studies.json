It is associated with low-renin hypertension, hypokalemia, excess androgens (especially androstenedione), and genital ambiguity in affected females. The differential biochemical diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by 11-β-hydroxylase deficiency includes finding increased serum concentrations of deoxycorticosterone, 11-desoxycortisol and androstenedione, and suppressed plasma renin concentrations. The disorder may be treated by administration of glucocorticoids.

        "use": "<div><p>11-oxo-androgens are emerging biomarkers for androgen production of adrenal origin. These biomarkers will be useful in disease in men and women and children. Although the presence of androgens with oxygen at the 11 position of the steroid backbone have been known for some time, the clinical utility and prevalence of these androgens have only recently come to light. As has been the case historically, the research has been enhanced with availability of good assay techniques, in this case HPLC MS/MS. 11-ketotestosterone and 11-ketodihydrotestosterone bind the androgen receptor as well as testosterone and DHT.<sup>1</sup> The 11-oxo-androgens also follow the same metabolic pathways as androgens without oxygen at 11. Interestingly, the origin of 11-oxo-androgens is entirely adrenal. All of this is important because 11-oxo-androgens appear to play a significant role in some endocrine diseases.</p><p><b>PCOS:</b> Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disease characterized by amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea and excess androgens. Although this syndrome is found in 5-10% of women, the disease is not well understood. 11-ketotestosterone has been shown to be in excess in PCOS patients, and levels in those patients are in fact higher than levels of testosterone.<sup>3</sup> This finding significantly points to the adrenal as a source of the excess androgens. This idea is supported by the similarity of the levels found in adult men and women. 11-ketotestosterone may be a better biomarker than testosterone or androstenedione for androgen excess in women with PCOS.</p><p><b>CAH:</b> Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is a genetic disease affecting about 1/10,000 people.<sup>4</sup> The enzyme defect that causes the disease causes excess adrenal androgen production driven by ACTH, and the major androgens are 11-oxygenated.<sup>2</sup> Therefore, 11-oxoandrogens are important to monitor for control of CAH, especially in children and women. In men, 11-oxo-androgens are proposed to be biomarkers for disease activity because they are of adrenal origin. Although excess androgens are a lesser problem for adult men with CAH, these patients are subject to other sequelae of CAH, especially TARTS (testicular adrenal-rest tumors). Following 11-oxo-androgens is expected to be a uniquely useful biomarker since testosterone is not useful as an adrenal androgen for adult men.<sup>6</sup></p><p><b>Puberty:</b> Adrenarche is a stage of development that precedes puberty; clinically it is defined by axillary hair and body odor; biochemically it is defined by a rise in adrenal androgens, such as DHEA-sulfate. Testosterone levels do not rise significantly during adrenarche. Recent academic research shows that during adrenarche both DHEA-sulfate and 11-ketotestosterone rise.<sup>7</sup> However, DHEA-sulfate is not an active androgen, while 11-ketotestosterone is fully active. Therefore, 11-ketotestosterone may be measured along with DHEA-sulfate when investigating premature adrenarche and premature puberty.</p><p><b>Prostate Cancer:</b> The goal of GnRH agonist treatment, antiandrogens and 17-hydroxylase blockade is to minimize androgens in prostate cancer. Eliminating adrenal androgens has been helpful in castration-resistant prostate cancer, and it now appears that 11-ketotestosterone is an important adrenal androgen to control in castration-resistant prostate cancer.<sup>1,5</sup> 11-ketotestosterone may be an effective adrenal androgen biomarker to monitor in castration-resistant prostate cancer.</p></div>",

Although this syndrome is found in 5-10% of women, the disease is not well understood. 11-ketotestosterone has been shown to be in excess in PCOS patients, and levels in those patients are in fact higher than levels of testosterone.<sup>3</sup> This finding significantly points to the adrenal as a source of the excess androgens. This idea is supported by the similarity of the levels found in adult men and women. 11-ketotestosterone may be a better biomarker than testosterone or androstenedione for androgen excess in women with PCOS.</p><p><b>CAH:</b> Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is a genetic disease affecting about 1/10,000 people.<sup>4</sup> The enzyme defect that causes the disease causes excess adrenal androgen production driven by ACTH, and the major androgens are 11-oxygenated.<sup>2</sup> Therefore, 11-oxoandrogens are important to monitor for control of CAH, especially in children and women. In men, 11-oxo-androgens are proposed to be biomarkers for disease activity because they are of adrenal origin. Although excess androgens are a lesser problem for adult men with CAH, these patients are subject to other sequelae of CAH, especially TARTS (testicular adrenal-rest tumors). Following 11-oxo-androgens is expected to be a uniquely useful biomarker since testosterone is not useful as an adrenal androgen for adult men.<sup>6</sup></p><p><b>Puberty:</b> Adrenarche is a stage of development that precedes puberty; clinically it is defined by axillary hair and body odor; biochemically it is defined by a rise in adrenal androgens, such as DHEA-sulfate. Testosterone levels do not rise significantly during adrenarche. Recent academic research shows that during adrenarche both DHEA-sulfate and 11-ketotestosterone rise.<sup>7</sup> However, DHEA-sulfate is not an active androgen, while 11-ketotestosterone is fully active. Therefore, 11-ketotestosterone may be measured along with DHEA-sulfate when investigating premature adrenarche and premature puberty.</p><p><b>Prostate Cancer:</b> The goal of GnRH agonist treatment, antiandrogens and 17-hydroxylase blockade is to minimize androgens in prostate cancer. Eliminating adrenal androgens has been helpful in castration-resistant prostate cancer, and it now appears that 11-ketotestosterone is an important adrenal androgen to control in castration-resistant prostate cancer.<sup>1,5</sup> 11-ketotestosterone may be an effective adrenal androgen biomarker to monitor in castration-resistant prostate cancer.</p></div>",

Alternatively, the enzyme 17,20 lyase can convert 17-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). 17α-H and 17,20 lyase activity are both mediated by a single microsomal cytochrome P450 complex. </p><p>17-hydroxypregnenelone levels have been shown to remain in the normal range in patients with Cushing.<sup>3</sup> Levels can be suppressed with dexamethasone inhibition and increased with exogenous ACTH stimulation.<sup>3</sup> Levels during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle tend to be higher than during the luteal phase.<sup>3</sup> 17-hydroxypregnenelone levels have been shown to be elevated in patients with idiopathic hirsutism.<sup>4</sup></p></div>",

        "custom_additional_info": "<div><p>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting one of the enzymes required to synthesize cortisol from cholesterol in the adrenal gland.<sup>1-4</sup> Diminished production of cortisol leads to increased pituitary secretion of ACTH via the negative feedback mechanism, which in turn causes hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex. Excess production of hormones proximal to the enzymatic defect gives rise to various clinical phenotypes. The clinical symptoms of CAH directly result from either the deficiencies in mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid production or from the overproduction of precursors that are converted to androgens.<sup>1-4</sup> There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including a severely affected, \"salt-wasting\" form, a simple virilizing form with normal aldosterone production, and a mild \"nonclassic\" form that may be asymptomatic or may be associated with symptoms that may not be discovered until adulthood.<sup>1-5</sup></p><p>The incidence of classic CAH ranges from 1:10,000 to 1:20,000 births<sup>1</sup> but is more prevalent in some ethnic groups, particularly in remote geographic regions. The most common form of CAH occurs as the result of mutations in the <i>CYP21A2</i> gene, which results in 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD).<sup>1</sup> This enzyme converts 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone to deoxycorticosterone, respective precursors for cortisol and aldosterone. In Caucasians, 21-OHD accounts for more than 90% of all cases, whereas 5% are caused by 11-hydroxylase deficiency and other enzyme deficiencies and clinical phenotypes are less common.<sup>1,4</sup> In 21-OHD, reduced production of glucocorticoids can lead to adrenal crises with hypoglycemia and hypotension in the setting of an illness or physiological stress.<sup>2</sup> Approximately 75% of classic CAH cases also suffer aldosterone deficiency with clinical symptoms that can include poor feeding and failure to thrive, vomiting, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and apathy.<sup>1-4</sup> The excess 17-OHP and other unblocked precursors, pregnenolone and progesterone, are diverted in the adrenals to the production of dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, which are then peripherally converted to testosterone.<sup>1,2</sup> A key manifestation of this androgen overproduction is in utero virilization resulting in genital ambiguity in newborn females.<sup>1-4</sup> In fact, 21-OHD is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in females.<sup>8</sup> Males with 21-OHD appear normal at birth so the age at diagnosis in untreated boys varies according to the severity of disease.<sup>1-4</sup> If unrecognized and left untreated, both girls and boys undergo rapid postnatal growth and sexual precocity as well as premature maturation of the growth plates, ultimately resulting in reduced final height.<sup>1-4</sup></p><p>Neonatal screening and diagnosis of CAH is typically accomplished through the measurement of 17-OHP by immunoassay from filter paper (Guthrie) cards with subsequent confirmation in serum by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS).<sup>5</sup> In order to reduce the potential of false-negative results, the cutoff levels of neonatal 17-OHP screening assays are typically set so that approximately 1% of all tests are reported as positive. Given the low prevalence of CAH, only approximately one in every 100 neonates with a positive screening test will have CAH as confirmed by LC/MS-MS.<sup>1-5</sup></p><p>Standard medical treatment of CAH consists of oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration in order to suppress adrenal androgens and to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies.<sup>1-5</sup> Levels of 17-OHP, androstenedione, and plasma renin activity can be used to evaluate adequacy of therapy in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms.<sup>8</sup> A recent clinical practice guideline recommends monitoring treatment by measuring 17-OHP levels early in the morning and before medication.<sup>1</sup> This guideline states that 17-OHP should not be completely normalized because of risk of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome.<sup>1,8</sup> The target 17-hydroxyprogesterone range suggested for children with CAH is 400−1200 ng/dL.<sup>8</sup> Clinical factors dictate management of individual adults.<sup>8</sup></p><p>In addition to the classic salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms of CAH, there is also a mild \"nonclassic\" form of CAH (NC-CAH), which may show variable degrees of postnatal androgen excess but is sometimes asymptomatic.<sup>1,2,8</sup> NC-CAH is much more common than classic CAH, occurring in approximately 0.1% to 0.2% in the general Caucasian population but in as much as 2% in some populations, such as Ashkenazi Jews.<sup>1</sup> NC-CAH presents with a wide spectrum of phenotypes due to the complexity of gene duplications, deletions, rearrangements, and compound heterozygotes that cause the condition.<sup>1</sup> Like more severe forms of CAH, NC-CAH can present as salt-wasting and simple virilizing disease with growth acceleration, premature adrenarche, or menstrual abnormalities.<sup>2</sup> NC-CAH is a relatively common cause of hyperandrogenic symptoms in women and has been implicated in between 2% and 5% of cases studied.<sup>9-11</sup> The diagnosis of nonclassic CAH after infancy is accomplished by measuring an early morning baseline serum 17-OHP in symptomatic individuals.<sup>1-5,8</sup> Measurement of other steroids after a cosyntropin stimulation can be used to differentiate 21-OHD from 11-hydroxylase and P450 oxidoreductase deficiencies and to make the diagnosis in borderline cases.<sup>1-5,8</sup></p></div>",

                "value": "<div><p>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting one of the enzymes required to synthesize cortisol from cholesterol in the adrenal gland.<sup>1-4</sup> Diminished production of cortisol leads to increased pituitary secretion of ACTH via the negative feedback mechanism, which in turn causes hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex. Excess production of hormones proximal to the enzymatic defect gives rise to various clinical phenotypes. The clinical symptoms of CAH directly result from either the deficiencies in mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid production or from the overproduction of precursors that are converted to androgens.<sup>1-4</sup> There is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including a severely affected, \"salt-wasting\" form, a simple virilizing form with normal aldosterone production, and a mild \"nonclassic\" form that may be asymptomatic or may be associated with symptoms that may not be discovered until adulthood.<sup>1-5</sup></p><p>The incidence of classic CAH ranges from 1:10,000 to 1:20,000 births<sup>1</sup> but is more prevalent in some ethnic groups, particularly in remote geographic regions. The most common form of CAH occurs as the result of mutations in the <i>CYP21A2</i> gene, which results in 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD).<sup>1</sup> This enzyme converts 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone to deoxycorticosterone, respective precursors for cortisol and aldosterone. In Caucasians, 21-OHD accounts for more than 90% of all cases, whereas 5% are caused by 11-hydroxylase deficiency and other enzyme deficiencies and clinical phenotypes are less common.<sup>1,4</sup> In 21-OHD, reduced production of glucocorticoids can lead to adrenal crises with hypoglycemia and hypotension in the setting of an illness or physiological stress.<sup>2</sup> Approximately 75% of classic CAH cases also suffer aldosterone deficiency with clinical symptoms that can include poor feeding and failure to thrive, vomiting, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and apathy.<sup>1-4</sup> The excess 17-OHP and other unblocked precursors, pregnenolone and progesterone, are diverted in the adrenals to the production of dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, which are then peripherally converted to testosterone.<sup>1,2</sup> A key manifestation of this androgen overproduction is in utero virilization resulting in genital ambiguity in newborn females.<sup>1-4</sup> In fact, 21-OHD is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in females.<sup>8</sup> Males with 21-OHD appear normal at birth so the age at diagnosis in untreated boys varies according to the severity of disease.<sup>1-4</sup> If unrecognized and left untreated, both girls and boys undergo rapid postnatal growth and sexual precocity as well as premature maturation of the growth plates, ultimately resulting in reduced final height.<sup>1-4</sup></p><p>Neonatal screening and diagnosis of CAH is typically accomplished through the measurement of 17-OHP by immunoassay from filter paper (Guthrie) cards with subsequent confirmation in serum by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS).<sup>5</sup> In order to reduce the potential of false-negative results, the cutoff levels of neonatal 17-OHP screening assays are typically set so that approximately 1% of all tests are reported as positive. Given the low prevalence of CAH, only approximately one in every 100 neonates with a positive screening test will have CAH as confirmed by LC/MS-MS.<sup>1-5</sup></p><p>Standard medical treatment of CAH consists of oral glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid administration in order to suppress adrenal androgens and to compensate for adrenal steroid deficiencies.<sup>1-5</sup> Levels of 17-OHP, androstenedione, and plasma renin activity can be used to evaluate adequacy of therapy in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms.<sup>8</sup> A recent clinical practice guideline recommends monitoring treatment by measuring 17-OHP levels early in the morning and before medication.<sup>1</sup> This guideline states that 17-OHP should not be completely normalized because of risk of iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome.<sup>1,8</sup> The target 17-hydroxyprogesterone range suggested for children with CAH is 400−1200 ng/dL.<sup>8</sup> Clinical factors dictate management of individual adults.<sup>8</sup></p><p>In addition to the classic salt-wasting and simple virilizing forms of CAH, there is also a mild \"nonclassic\" form of CAH (NC-CAH), which may show variable degrees of postnatal androgen excess but is sometimes asymptomatic.<sup>1,2,8</sup> NC-CAH is much more common than classic CAH, occurring in approximately 0.1% to 0.2% in the general Caucasian population but in as much as 2% in some populations, such as Ashkenazi Jews.<sup>1</sup> NC-CAH presents with a wide spectrum of phenotypes due to the complexity of gene duplications, deletions, rearrangements, and compound heterozygotes that cause the condition.<sup>1</sup> Like more severe forms of CAH, NC-CAH can present as salt-wasting and simple virilizing disease with growth acceleration, premature adrenarche, or menstrual abnormalities.<sup>2</sup> NC-CAH is a relatively common cause of hyperandrogenic symptoms in women and has been implicated in between 2% and 5% of cases studied.<sup>9-11</sup> The diagnosis of nonclassic CAH after infancy is accomplished by measuring an early morning baseline serum 17-OHP in symptomatic individuals.<sup>1-5,8</sup> Measurement of other steroids after a cosyntropin stimulation can be used to differentiate 21-OHD from 11-hydroxylase and P450 oxidoreductase deficiencies and to make the diagnosis in borderline cases.<sup>1-5,8</sup></p></div>",
